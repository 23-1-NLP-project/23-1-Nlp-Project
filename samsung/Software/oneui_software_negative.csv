radios on that shit were garbage and the bugs on the software were annoying af.
i want samsung software with chinese hardware
oneui is killer imo.
i was shocked to see how many features were missing compared to oneui
the pixel 4xl had a better camera and no software bloat.
"having everything samsung caused so many headaches with what would work with what, and what software each device had to be on for it to work correctly."
"in terms of software use i would be watching youtube or surfing the web and everything would suddenly freeze - couldn't exit, couldn't switch apps or change volume, only option was to turn off and back on."
"you realize stock camera app is tied to software optimalization, not just hardware

thats why a lot of android phone users tend to download gcam instead of their native camera app because google tend to do coding better"
nothing else gives me the versatility of oneui.
"> oneui is better than stock pixel now

now?"
samsung will need at least another two iterations of rdna for the software to catch up.
"more proof that samsung can cram all the tech they want in their flagships, until they address their abysmal software it's going to be like this"
"you mean aside from:
- improved primary camera sensor/improved camera software algorithms for improved clarity/autofocus improvements/can now do 8k30fps video
- significantly more powerful cpu/gpu
- improved cooling system
- faster ram
- faster storage with move from ufs 3."
are you on the latest software version?
samsung couldnt do it and tries to fix it with software updates and its getting worse and worse
every devices they produce has two software supporting them.
"android competition with: 

-the best amoled panels (they build/sell panels to their competition but keep their best for themselves)

‐the longest and punctual software support (this is where lg ate shit & also where samy took a shot at daddy google lol)

‐stoopid lucrative trade-in promos & screen replacement service

‐proactive in hardware revisions (re-signing with tsmc thru 2030 to make their flagship socs when they'd finally realize their in-house made sd888 & sd8gen1 are ""flaming"" dogshit, arguably)

‐chokeholding their own fanbase (they don't give af about removing the sdcard, headphone jack, included charging bricks, or your feelings about those moves."
"although yes, the full-size iphone 13 is $100aud more expensive than the s22 at $1,349aud while the s22 is at $1,249aud, you get three years of *full software updates* at most on the galaxy."
even the adobe apps on the samsung side of house are lacking because adobe treats us android folks like peasants with mediocre software ports.
that's a lot of rhetoric for simply using a different software ;) just use what you want.
"oneui is its an os built on top of andriod
it has its own app store, features and ecosystem."
oneui is samsung's fork and will always be delayed and bloated.
she gets the next android update around a year before i get a oneui update to the same android level.
last time i got a oneui upgrade i received zero updates for 5 or 6 months beforehand and my ota update was many months behind the usa.
"like, i know that iphones might have better performance, software, cameras and if i had other apple devices, a more seamless ecosystem."
the ui just doesn't make a lot of sense compared to oneui
oneplus has lost a lot of ground in the past years due to bad decisions like merging software.
google's pixel is good and has mid and high end model but at least from my research they tend to have tons of software issues (lol) and unless you are geek that likes to beta test they are not for majority of people.
"they have less innovation compared to years ago however - they still have one of the best cameras, they have the beat display each year, their soc (not exynos) is always the best android can offer, offer shit ton of features that other softwares don't ( of course some companies have things that samsung doesn't but are not as feature rich overall) and the experiance is almost appleesque."
samsung has been making iphone displays for a long time but they always had poor software choices and calibration.
"jpg

> the problem also occurs after doing the device optimization software process."
> the device is on the latest software version.
oneui looks like a toy os with all the weird icons.
you need to improve the software.
"i've found pixels/oneplus phones to be lacking in features in comparison, and lately samsung has been the most stable in software on the android side."
s23 with software update will probably make it better.

"sure, there are chinese companies that do certain aspects better, but they are either not available in many markets or the software situation is a joke in comparison."
"personally, what i wanted was the stability and ecosystem of an iphone with the software ethos of android."
"sony offers things with hardware sure, but their integration is bad, their software support is laughable for the price point, and the availability is almost non-existent."
software is garbage.
"at least my personal experience iphone has the best face unlock, best performance, longest software support, holds value, better battery life, all the apps run a lot better on ios, whatever works, works flawlessly why would you buy the wanna be iphone samsung phone?"
"samsung could well have identified a critical software issue, which could end up in the phone in a bootloop or bricked if certain conditions are met."
"any time a security or functionality update comes out, it has every bug fix, security upgrade and software patch your device needs to keep working correctly."
praise samsung for packing their devices with such heavy software and frail phones.
