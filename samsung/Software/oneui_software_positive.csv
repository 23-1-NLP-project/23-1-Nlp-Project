samsung is selling to the whole world also has better software and general support.
"love the pixel software and no one canâ€™t beat apple customer service, no one."
"its actually pretty easy

you have dedicated os to one dedicated lineup of phones

there is thousands of phones with android, its harder to tweak the camera software"
oneui is significantly nicer looking than ios is and has far more features
you have to use different software on a pc now (yourphone - which is actually great).
"with oneui 4 (and the 5 is almost here) they introduced many more ecosystem things, for example some apps can show controls on your phone when you use them in the tablet."
"i just prefer android phones and the android software experience, and samsung is doing it the best for me right now, so i'm going to use samsungs for the foreseeable."
"the differences are:
- improved primary camera sensor/improved camera software algorithms for improved clarity/autofocus improvements/can now do 8k30fps video
- significantly more powerful cpu/gpu
- improved cooling system
- faster ram
- faster storage with move from ufs 3."
"i look at the specs, hardware, ecosystem, software experience and price, then pick what appeals to me the most."
"not sure if the s22 series is any better, or what the s23 will bring, but when it comes to software, optimisation trumps features all day every day and at the minute, apple has nailed it."
"com, it will have a fresh, less bloated software."
"come to think of it, samsung devices have extremely good qc software team."
"korea (and china to some extent) for things related to ""in-depth"" explanations and software developments (one ui, software updates, camera improvememts) since a lot of users from those regions use that members app to read about technical stuff samsung is doing or something along those lines."
"right, because that's how software works."
"imo, samsung has the best ui and software support of all the android manufacturers that i tried."
oneui is a significant improvement over their old ui(touchwiz) and i actually prefer it over stock android.
samsung's software and now support for their devices is pretty much best in class.
"apple is currently only ahead in terms of software stabilization, which agreed, is cinematically smooth."
they offer superior software support even compared to google.
even though it wont get software os updates for too long i still really love them.
"that said, once samsung decided to focus on software rather than incomplete hardware features, they led the charge for things like software support, ecosystem development, pc integration, cellular reception, etc in a package that was accessible to pretty much everyone."
their innovation in both hardware and software is still miles ahead of the rest of market.
samsung has tremendously improved on software updates over the last few years.
"fr the thing im most concerned about when switching from samsung is how much i will miss oneui 
it's just so good and feature rich"
can't believe i'm going to say this but oneui is better than stock pixel now.
and most of these simply prefer samsung's software and will recommend these over chinese phones.
