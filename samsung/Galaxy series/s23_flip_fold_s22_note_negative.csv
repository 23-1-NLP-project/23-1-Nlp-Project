i have the s21 ultra guess i won't be up grading or should i say downgrading to the s22.
i would also say that most people did not get the s23u for the 100x zoom.
stay away from the base s22 since the battery is cheeks.
"you should exchange it for new one (if you have warranty)
that isn't normal for s22 even if it's exynos"
not only because of choppy video but also straight up lag and it hasn't even been a year with s22 plus.
after the debacle with the fold 4 i’m not sure il get a samsung again.
"i use a specific fingerprint to open a certain app, in my case it's the secure folder."
its from the same generation as the note 20 ultra.
"honestly, that doesn't matter when the 7 pro is cheaper than the base s23 in my country."
who says u gotta get the s23 compared to the pixel 7 pro when a midrange samsung has these batteries + a midrange cpu for additional battery savings.
my samsung a52 5g midranger puts my brothers s22 to shame and still runs all the emulators etc.
s22's below average battery is one of its biggest con.
"if you have an s22 right now that you've restored from backup, go to settings > general management > reset > reset all settings."
a phone with the s pen is no different whether it's called note or ultra.
i had a friend who had the same problem with the s22.
i have a similar experience on my snapdragon s22.
"don't worry, the s22 series already were down hard globally, there is no reason s23 costs the same, its the same phone with yearly new chip and updated camera sensor yet charging 1200$ lmao and in the case of the ultra only main cam were updated, the zooms lenses/sensors are 3 years old and identical."
uh huh… s23 is still in the top of the line tier and the fe is the equiv lower rung….
i'm so mad the base s23 doesn't have that red variant.
this is s22u all over again.
"these tests showed similar results (9h of sot) for s22u and then, in reality mine lasts 4,5 max."
there is twitter screen showing 5:30 for s23u.
i am on my 2nd s23 ultra.
get a low cost or used low cost phone for a year and then get the s23 or s23+ snapdragon or s23 ultra snapdragon.
the whole cooling and throttling issue should be solved throughout this year in time for the s23 series.
"itried the s21 ultra, but the drawbacks from upgrading from a note 10+ were too much."
i'm almost ashamed of buying my wife a samsung s22 from her iphone.
"that's interesting, i can't activate hdr10+ in my s23u when i have 8k30 and high bitrate set."
camera is not as good as samsung though -- (switched from a samsung note 9)
i got fed up and traded it in for the fold 4.
thinking about giving my s22 plus in exchange for s23 ultra.
i bought s22 plus and have been plagued by battery woes.
not possible to fit in a foldable.
you dont have these features in smaller sensors found in foldables.
"i got the iphone 13 pro max and have tried a few android phones (z fold 3, s21+, pixel 6 pro) and they’re all shit compared to the iphone."
but the better phone s23 ultra will get that shittastic curved screen.
"i had issues with an s8+, note 10, and a few of their watches."
my friend's oppo reno 5g runs 10x better than my s22.
"i am getting the s23 ultra for $200 because my note 20 is worth $1,000 on trade in."
my s22 is so bad.
the s22 line came out back in february and it's m12 process wasn't ready at that point so they used the m11 process which is what will go into all upcoming iphone 14s that are not the pro.
only the pro will get the m12 process as will the upcoming samsung fold series.
the entire s22 lineup share the same chip (other than the exynos/snapdragon variants)
"and here i am contemplating on buying the 23 ultra having a 14 pro…

i also have the fold 4 but those cameras are so bad compared to iphone or the ultra"
bro my s22 with 120hz and light usage drains extremely quickly.
does the flip 4 battery get you through the day easily?
i got to tried both in a shop today for a bit and the screen protector on the flip seemed quite a bit less pleasant than the naked screens of s22+ or the new iphones
they didn't strip anything from s21 > s22 and s22 > s23 so your rant about them taking something away every generation is a ridiculous exaggeration.
unless the pixel fold just blows me away.
even if it's the snapdragon model you still wouldn't want to play on a s22 cuz it's simply not built for gaming due to its tiny size and shitty chip
i got a flip four and within a month i got a pixel that bled through green which promptly turned into a little dead pixel spot.
i took it to service down the street you fix break whatever and they told me that samsung told them that they wouldn't pay for any replacement of screens of flips.
"my s10+ stopped working few weeks after warranty ended, screen turned greeen and wasn't responding, my s21+ went on check with samsung, because it got so hot it wasn't possible to hold it on face druing call and it never came back from repair and s22u has bad battery and reception."
"i swore, s22u would be my last samsung, yet here i am thinking about s23u, but until i see solid reviews and all people praising battery, i won't buy a thing."
"i have a fold 4, a tv, the widescreen 34in oled monitor, a tab s8 ultra and a fold 4."
if apple comes out with a folding iphone i would jump on it in a heartbeat.
the s21's 888 was not he best processor and neither is the s22u 8gen1.
"even that, they reduced the battery sizs and still heating issues (according to people complaining in /r/galaxys22"
i even found a video on youtube that explained how to get samsung notes on my non-samsung laptop and i haven't gone back to google keep or onenote since.
"although the app could use some optimizing i think because it seems to run quite heavy, leading to a substantial increase in temperature and the battery drains as if the bottom fell out, atleast on my z flip3."
the other iphones gets beaten by the s23u and also s23+ by a margin.
i had a fold for about two years and i fell for the hype and moved to apple last year.
"if the exynos s22 is sold in your country, just get a samsung mid-range phone or an iphone"
i am in a very similar situation except it is with my new galaxy z fold 4.
i hate the boring island less design that samsung has continued since s22.
"in my case it outlasted my s22 ultra every day
then again the s22 chip was flawed , snapdragon 8 gen 1 was a failure."
"in terms of ui, my apps would sometimes jumble up into a clusterfuck when i was trying to sort them into folders."
"the screens are designed to survive 200,000 folds, around 100 times a day for five years."
apple doesn't have a folding phone though.
i've just grown to love folding phones too much.
"as it stands with the s23u, i'd take better cameras than better battery tech (or soc efficiency), if i had to pick one."
"for the s22u, i'd pick a better soc than camera, if i had to pick one."
"sd 888 & 8 gen 1 have very bad heat and efficiency issues, but the s23 fixed them."
"""please note that this is a smartphone and not a teenagers first shitbox car"""
it doesn't seem that different from the s22u.
the only exception was the note 5
com/r/s22ultraphotography/comments/xz6mv9/nikon\_5600\_vs\_s22\_ultrapretty\_close\_if\_you\_ask\_me/?
my tiktok/reddit addiction is not good for the battery life on my s22u.
com/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-exynos-display-test/
apparently next samsung phone beginning with the s23 it gonna be sd and no more exynos
"removing sd card support, cutting ram down to 8 gbs on the base variant of note 22 ultra."
i see you haven't heard of the s23 series.
"it also smashed the s22 ultra in motion, touch and artefacts."
"s22 ulta delivery today, been in iphone hell for about 3 yrs now."
a person blurred the moon then took a picture of it and the s23 ultra sharpened details that were not there.
"depending on your phone condition, you might be able to sell your note 20 ultra for more than $200."
the new snapdragons in the fold 4 sounds like a big jump up and a new gen is expected in the s23 ultras next year.
the 8 gen 2 for the s23 ultra is a overclocked custom version.
the only phone from samsung we might get excited this year is fold 5.
i've had a samsung since 2014 with the note 4 and almost switched earlier this year.
the ultra have had 5000mah batteries since that line was introduced and with the s23+ getting better battery life than the 23u it's time to increase that.
how long did you use your s22?
s22 has terrible battery life.
"also if you really want one of the s22 series phones you could always import it, the snapdragon version is usually much better in every way, look into it."
the fold 4 is a better productivity phone.
"i had a oneplus 7 pro since launch but it's microphone started having problems, battery life was lasting 3hrs of screen on time (7 screen off), 

i purchased the s22 ultra exynos at black friday hoping that as it was one of the most expensive android phones out there it would be great but i was very disappointed; battery life was not that good, speakers were awfull compared to op7 pro's (sounding like a cheap tiny 5$ chinese speaker), screen colours were not customizable as much as on oneplus and in my eyes red tones looked ""muddy""/""too soft"", video was very bad especially when using social media apps such as insta for story as zooming in was very laggy, there was a lot of noise (blue noise with artifacts) even at day in some scenarios."
"i therefore returned the s22 ultra after 2 weeks but few weeks ago my oneplus front camera stopped working so i ordered the s23 ultra

i now had the s23 ultra for 3 days, and speaker really got improved, sounding a bit better that the oneplus,  screen is the same so still red tones too muddy in my opinion and not enough screen colours customisation, for video the noise issue got solved, noise is nowhere near as bad in video and camera switching in social media apps is not as laggy as on s22 ultra, i still prefer the colours of videos on the op7 pro, which look more pleasing to the eyes and the fact that photos are more natural looking on op7 pro with less oversharpening and better colours."
"i get only 4-5 hours of screen on time with the s23 ultra with qhd+, 120hz variable refresh rate and auto brightness, same setting (90hz) with brand new oneplus after release was giving me 7-8hrs of screen on time which was way better, hope this is just because battery didn't addapt to my usage yet or an update will fix it."
i would recomend an s20 fe or a used note 20 ultra probably.
hell a used note 9 or 10 is like $200
"also i need a small phone for my tiny hands ,the s22 supposed to be thr only option in a world full of 6."
especially now between the s23 ultra and 14 pro max.
"yeah i agree the swap won't be as noticeable but i personally think you underestimate the difference for example the s23 ultra comes with a new 200mp camera, has a much brighter screen, much more powerful chip(especially if you're in europe) and much better battery life, i'm going from the s21 ultra to the s23 ultra mostly for battery life and chip performance especially as i'm in uk and have a shitty exynos chip plus i've never had a note so i'm excited to have an s pen and boxed shaped phone"
the second time my new fold 4 wouldn't connect to my cars bluetooth and the guy said i was screwed and that my cars bluetooth was too old.
"if i were to buy a foldable (which i won't, because spending £2000 on a phone is excesive, i could buy myself a high-end laptop for that kind of money), i'd probably buy a second or third generation pixel fold, though that'll probably not happen for the foreseeable future."
i'd rather buy nothing and keep the s22 ultra.
"the only thing newish that has come out, are the folds and flip, and probably google pixel that actually implements new useful smart features."
>the s/d 8 gen 2 in the s23 series fixed this
s23u is more expensive than the 14pm in my market.
and the trade-in values for the previous s22u model were like $500 vs $730 of the 13pm.
this exact test showed over 9 hours for s22u.
my s22u barely reaches 5 during interactions with 4g/5g network.
will it last like ip14 pro max where s22u lasted 4 hours of sot?
i have s22 ultra.
"i have s10, a52 5g and s23 ultra"
you should probably factory reset the phone like the other [op that had a s22 ultra](https://old.
com/r/samsung/comments/v52a70/1_month_update_after_factory_resetting_my_s22/).
i remember samsung flaunting (i don't remember whether it was the s21 or s22) that they worked with instagram and snapchat to get the image quality to look better.
"png

this also doesn’t touch the other issues the s22 has with motion and artefacts

doesn’t really matter."
note 20 ultra owner here.
i am getting an s23u with 512gb for $200 after trade-in with t-mo in usa.
"bought the s23 ultra to try to ""understand"" why people so hype about it."
"tldr:    
pixel 7 pro - 8hrs 50mins    
s22 ultra (snapdragon) - 9hrs 43mins     
one plus 11 - 10hrs 16mins   
xiaomi 13 pro - 10hrs 26mins   
s23 ultra - 11hrs 15mins   
iphone 14 pro max - 11hrs 25mins"
"first days with my s23u the battery lasted 18 h with 1 charge and the sot was 10h (with little light gaming) and screen off 8h, but 2 weeks from that (right now) i feel that something changed and battery dont last too much like before,  im barely obtaining 7-6h sot and if i play some game it drains like 5 to 8% in 10 minutes."
com/r/s22ultraphotography/comments/11p8d3e/gcam_10x20x_no_ai/?
"haven't been happy with the s22, bad battery life, and always running hot."
i made this switch last year from the 13pm to the s22 ultra.
i’ll be honest and say that for years i’ve been on apple and stood by them but lately i’ve been wanting to try android and recently picked up a s22+ but for me i’m having a hard time letting the ecosystem go 😭
"my friend also had problems with her fold 3, after 3 or so months the screen started to crack in the middle and leak black shit, took her 4 months of fighting both her telco and samsung before they replaced it."
"unfortunately i fell into the trap, my battery started dying on my s10+ which is less than ideal and got a deal on the s22+ including trading in all i paid was $380~ and i still think it's not worth it."
going to another country and getting an s22 ultra would fix it
not once has my s22u flipped or rotated a moon.
if you are a s22 ultra owner or zfold 4 owner why are you so trigger happy to upgrade?
"only people that should really be looking to upgrade are s20 ultra owners, note10+ owners, heck i’ll even say note20 ultra owners"
i have samsung q80 tv and s22 ultra phone.
torn between the s22+ or the ultra.
"i bought a brand new s22u and in a month the spen had melted from the top half, possibly due to over heating while charging."
"the response is pretty shitty, considering a big chunk of the phone launch was spent showing how the s23u can be used to shoot movie quality footage"
really hope there’s a white s23 ultra…don’t like the cream one or are they just the same?
otherwise it literally is the same you can’t justify trading in your s22 ultra unless it’s broken lol
i have 512gb of space on my fold 4.
never even filled up my note 20 ultra which was 128gb.
"sold my s22 ultra and purchased a used s21 ultra for half the price second hand, the s22s line is abnormally bad"
"aside from the fact that an s22 is a very small phone and, i would think, a bigger screen gives a much better gaming experience."
see it this way: nobody would buy a normal business notebook for gaming and complain that the games do not run as smooth as he would like them to; it just does not make sense.
if i am planning to capture long forms of video with the s23 ultra is it best to go for 8k or is it better to down scale to 4k?
"even with the s23u i end a heavy day with less than 30% battery, so if i forget to charge it during the night it could become a problem the next day."
the s23 isn’t entry level.
the new foldables will be the only thing to convince me out of one 😅
i'm using the newest samsung internet and accessing my notes right now on my phone.
"there is no return policy in my country and the re sell value of s22 is waaay below of what i paid, otherwise i wouldnt even bother post about this garbage."
i was impressed when comparing my friends s22u it to my dlsr but  now i'm laughing at how desperate samsung is to sell more phones.
most of the apps don't work so well if open in split screen like my fold.
now i have an s22 because the s20fe earpiece speaker went bad two months ago.
i've had this s22 for a few weeks now and it sucks balls.
how’s the battery on that s22+?
they are not much worse than the s23u but it takes a bit of settings to adjust.
check out reviews of the cpu inside your phone even the snapdragon s21 & s22 versions are terrible
too bad you aren't able to get the snapdragon s22 ultra.
fold 4 for personal consumption and s22ultra for business use only.
fold is so much better for enjoying content.
"as for your notes, take screenshots of them and copy and paste the notes and send them to yourself via email."
my wife has an s22 ultra and it looks practically identical to this phone.
"i have a note 20 ultra, and aside from the now isolated lens design, it looks almost just like this phone."
"hell, i don't even know what features make this phone that much of an improvement over my note 20 ultra."
when i upgraded at the time it was from the note 9.
i've been splitting my time between the s22+ and my pixel 6.
these photos were straight out of the s23 ultra.
"i had 4 pixels, loved the pixel 5, but my experience with the 6 and 6pro drove me to preorder the s23 ultra."
folding phones aren't innovation because they have become.
s23 ultra goes neck to neck with iphone 14 pro max and the dude be complaining about the battery capacity 💀.
"i’m getting the fold 4, apple phones need more work."
"i pre ordered s22+ and it was fine the first 2 months and then it just went down hill, battery is shit have to charge it half way through my day and i have a long list of apps that i have put in deep sleep."
bixby routines makes my s22+ randomly restart a few times a day and i have no idea why.
have you heard of the s23u?
"my first phone with a curved display was a note 8 and the things i listed above were the biggest complaints i had with that phone, and those same complaints hold true with my s22 ultra (with the addition of the fingerprint scanner being on the display)."
that's my main reason to upgrade from s22u to s23u.
"i didn't have ultra, but tested both s23 and s23+, eventually returning both."
i also noticed the frame drops on youtube clips with hi-res recordings from s23u.
submit a claim with the bbb that's the only way i've got them to fix things back when the note 20 came out i ordered them.
i upgraded to s23u from s22u and i disagree.
the battery life on the s23u is rumored to be a game changer on par with 14 pro max.
thats a very significantly reason to upgrade not making it same as s22u.
with the s22u you are constantly looking at the battery meter all day long fearing it will run out.
thats not the case with s23u
*cries in base s22*
it would have been a better comparison to see the base model s23 and not the ultra which already has 5000mah  capacity
i got the s23u for $600 ([google fi deal](https://fi.
"lg v60 for 250 usd have about 9 hrs of sot, while s22 ultra is struggling to get to 8."
"i didn't like the s22 i sent mine back, and i ended up getting a mid ranged one instead which has given me a better experience than the flag ship surprisingly"
though i still wanted to have s23 ultra to have best of both world.
my s22 ultra gets hot so fast and super laggy.
neither does the s22?
"although yes, the full-size iphone 13 is $100aud more expensive than the s22 at $1,349aud while the s22 is at $1,249aud, you get three years of *full software updates* at most on the galaxy."
"accounting for that, the price per year of the iphone (\~$270aud) is $150aud more than the s22 (\~$420aud)."
"plus iphones have much less trailing text blur when scrolling and they dont have black smear, which s22u (and probably s23u) still have at low brightness"
"my last 4 phones are from samsung(a70, note 10+, s21, a73)."
i have not tried the s22 series so i cannot comment on the battery life but my a73 is a battery beast.
"honestly this is why i'll never buy a foldable, the technology just isn't there yet to have a reliable phone that won't all of a sudden break on you."
upgrading from a s22 to a s23.
when s21 base/+/u vs s22 base/+/u vs s23 base/+/u to compare these 9 models against each other?
"i don't think it can be disputed that samsung s22 ultras, at least, use better displays than what apple puts in their phones."
the s22 did pretty well when active but was poorly optimized when not in use
and in  s22 series samsung reduced the battery capacity (only ultra model) still uses the same huge battery.
yeah i had bad performance with my s22u.
upgraded to the s23u and can definitely say that the issues that i had my with s22u were solved by the s23u.
much needed for sure but not enough to tell a s22 user to trade in their phone for this year’s phone.
use a flip 4 for personal use.
"as far as waiting on the fold 5, if it comes with better cameras it would be worth the wait ( low light is my only complaint on fold 4 cameras)."
"only getting 4-5h on a full charge with 120hz, adaptive brightness and qhd+ 

[s23u battery life ss, 3rd day ](https://imgur."
it's the only remaining area where notes from 4 years ago are better.
the s23u has 30% in the tank when s22u runs out.
my s23 ultra is amazing and the photos some other site has shown are just plain wrong
foldables have bad cameras.
"to be fair, i have a decent dslr and a nice lens, but a vast majority of the time i prefer to shoot with my phone (previously my note 20 ultra and now the s23 ultra)."
"my s23 ultra lasts like, 1."
"i am not optimistic with the s23u for the battery life, but i will wait for more testing."
after reducing it on the s22.
"i have the s23u used it for 3 days and i get constant 4-5 h battery on full charge, with adaptive brightness, variable 120hz and qhd+

this is really bad for a brand new phone but battery still needs to adapt to my usage

[s23u battery life ss at 3rd day of use ](https://imgur."
but i no longer have the s22.
i wish the s23+ also had it.
"i have the note 20 5g and note 20 ultra 5g (exynos) and get around 3hrs sot with 5g enabled, 4-5hrs sot with 5g off."
"as a matter of fact, i am typing this from an s23 ultra that i only paid $200 for."
"there was absolutely no need to axe the whole note line, they could have merged and integrated the spen on a combined device such that an s series phone would have an spen."
"but nooooo, they had to force note fans to buying the highest damn configuration just to get a function phone with an spen."
i'm having overheating and stuttering issues on my brand new s22 with diablo inmortal too.
there is battery tests showing the s23+ lasts even longer than the s23u.
but issues i’m seeing with the s22 ultra caused me to pause.
"i have a note 20 ultra and almost never use the samsung specific stuff, just plain android features."
servicing a car has nothing to do with samsung and their substandard fold 4.
"all things the same you should get 15% more battery than the s22u running the same usage pattern, and near the 14 pro max."
i gave up after my experience with the note7 my wife however still loves samsung phones
"hence, why i'm anxiously waiting to get my pre-ordered s23 ultra on delivery day."
sounds like a bad phone as opposed to the whole series of s22 are bad.
i bet they won't do for the s22 cuz i bought it
"if you want to get excited move to a foldable but for me the fold are too far behind in things like durability, camera quality and battery life."
"however, all the recent comparisons i saw between the s23u and ip14 pm shows samsung offering better highlights and shadows."
"yea, stills are better on the note / samsung."
"example - gallery, internet, messages and samsung free are 4 i have in a folder i can't remove."
actually they made snapdragon the chipset on korean s22u.
my s22 ultra was a let down.
i've had nothing but problems with my s22 but its mostly little things i came from ios with the nice silky smooth performance i get that sometimes on my s22 but its not as consistent like my iphone
it took me a bit to hook my phone up to my samsung tv for screen share but i do appreciate the smart things app and i hope it's less clunky than my first s22 ultra linking experience (had to download the driver/app for my tv and it kept failing).
yeah the vivo fold looks so good the fact that the fold 4 is going to have the same smaller outer screen is complete trash
my s21 ultra (4 separate units in 1 year) followed by this s22 ultra i al using (3rd unit in 5 months) have been the absolute worst devices i have ever had the experince of using.
"whereas i have used s7, s8, note8, s9, s10 and now s22+."
so the battery life is hit or miss with the s22 series and some other series as well.
do you mind please telling me how the fold 4 compares to the s22?
looks like my s22+ don't see a difference at all lol.
the iphone 14 pro will have the newer m12 oled which wasn't available earlier for the s22 ultra.
the s22u uses an m11 oled that is nearly identical to the one on the s21u.
the z fold 4 is the only other device atm to use samsung's m12 oled.
s22 ultra got highest end m11 ltpo oled because m12 wasn't ready yet while iphone 14 pro will get newer m12 ltpo.
my friend received his s22 and the camera doesn't work lol.
"since 8 gen 2 is manufactured by tsmc unlike the 8 gen 1 and most exynos that manufactured by samsung semiconductor, the battery life should be better on the s23 than it's predecessor."
"what has been ""stripped"" from the s22 ultra on the s23u?"
"if you are trying to move from the s22u, its basically the same thing."
i'm on my phone literally from 6am till about 9pm daily before i get down to 15% s22 ultra
i have snapdragon version of s22 ultra.
to be honest if samsung wants to keep fans should take all s22 series from their customers and give iphones to them
i think i'll swap back when they change the design or perhaps when they do their foldable (type c for godsakes).
looks like it only works on notes and samsung internet.
samsung is only just caught upto apples quality with s22+ and s22 ultra.
"they also said that with me when i had my note9 fixed under warranty, did not pay anything."
"ordered myself an s23 ultra, glad i waited."
"i love my flip, but i just wish it had a better battery, camera, and they could add some of the s health features."
i was thinking about downgrading my 13 pro max to the note 20 ultra or note 10 plus.
s21 ultra or a note 10+ would be good options.
"""please note that it's a smartphone and not a video camera"" 
but clearly professionals expected to be able to use it as such, based on the marketing."
i have both and photography is my hobby and i literally have no preference when i use fold4 or s22u because both of them perform really good for a phone nearly identical to each other.
wow the s23 ultra is about the same battery as the iphone 14 pro max that's insane upgrade from the s22 ultra glad i upgraded
"just curious, what s23 ultra did you bought 256gb or higher?"
"samsung also got caught trying to advertise their non-ltpo s22 panels going down to 10hz but that's just their lowest data drive refresh, and those oleds only really go down to 48hz."
"with the case of the base s22, nothing, it would drain its battery by itself in a few hours."
"same here, iphone 13-> s22 ultra."
the s22u with 8gen1 was known to be garbage before it was launched.
there was videos by golden reviewer showing how crap the 8gen1 was last dec and there was articles about how samsung fabs was struggling with it poor yields before the s22u was launched.
anyone that was surprised by the s22u garbage battery life hadn't been doing their homework.
it lost to the s22 which is notoriously bad with battery life lol
i have yet to to see the battery life shown for the s22 ultra.
i ordered the s23u and i'm expecting probably 2 max 3 hours more (which would be more than enough for me).
the fold 4 is 23 or 24x9
i mean s23u had like 25% more screen resolution yet only 15% more battery and still matched the iphone 14 pro max in battery life
i have had a z fold 3 and s22.
"it is estimated that samsung has sold over 10,000,000 units of folding skus in 2022."
s22+ with exynos or snapdragon?
using them fold fold 3 repairs was horrendous.
the s22 series of phones are easily the worst phones samsung has manufactured in terms of efficiency.
well you did spent 1000€ on a s22 so why not spend that on ip13pro.
i've had the pixel 2 since launch and just switched to the samsung s22+ a month ago.
why are you comparing 14pro to s23/s23+?
that is why i didn't choose the samsung s23 ultra.
i use both and samsung s22+ and iphone 11 pro.
"500$ trade in for s22 ultra, after the trade in, i still have to pay 827$ with taxes."
i rather pay 827$ and get iphone14 and still keeping my s22 ultra !
i hate my s22 ultra on my first replacement and i got the original one jume 30th!
such as what they just did with the s23 series 🤷
"i have the s22 ultra for about 9months ( my first curved display, and first ever android) and i can say i just like flat displays more."
the sd 8 gen 2 in the s23 line-up has supposedly fixed those issues.
"there are already tons of comparisons of the i14 and s22u on youtube and it seems apple might beat samsung once again, so we'll have to wait and see what the s23 brings to the table."
"i guarantee that they would be raving about huge differences if the s23 lineup debuted with a new design, despite the fact that the external shape of the phone is the least important part of the device considering most phones look the same from the front."
"i didnt remain loyal lol, had other phones in parallel since the galaxy s2, note 3, onwards."
"if the folding mechanism has any external damage (chips, cracks, scuffss, etc) samsung will not cover it."
"i would be happy to pay a decent amount to upgrade, but $250 is just kind of insulting for s22."
my s22 has zero issues.
"my s22u only get somewhat decent battery life since the android 13 update, but still not to my liking."
s23 with software update will probably make it better.
i already pre-order a s23u because i am going back to vietnam soon and i need a phone with better efficiency and battery life.
i had a similar experience with the s22+ and sent it back.
i'll wait for the fold 4 as that always has the snapdragon chip for the uk market
"this year apple will get the better display because m12 ltpo wasn't ready for the s22 ultra, so they used m11 ltpo."
yeah the vivo fold looks so good the fact that the fold four is going to have the same smaller outer screen is complete trash
"aside from the note 5, i've had basically zero problems."
"but have to admit, i sometimes wish my s22 ultra is a flat screen."
in the case of a s22 user or s21 user that’s completely ridiculous and waste of money.
"i understand what you said but hear me out: my phone is a s22 ultra, i cracked the screen, then before i sent my phone i asked them if the phone was gonna be back to it's original specifications, that includes the ip68 rating which by their own website states: 1."
they just made big improvement on the battery and reused the zoom lenses and sensors from the s22u.
check out anandtech for more in depth analysis of how terribly inefficient the s21 and s22 chips are
can you explain the reasons why you hate the s22 ultra?
"i only have a back cover on mine and just tap on it to see if there is anything, if there is i pick it right up and don't need to flip it."
my note5 even had an s pen where i could use to write my notes and to type / draw things.
galaxy buds 2 (traded in my buds live) and galaxy watch 4 and my samsung 22 ultra ( upgrade from the samsung note 20 5g.
i say it won't make 5:30 sot to 11:15 sot and that s23 sot will vary.
"if it did, i would have 9 hours of sot on my s22u and not 4."
does anyone know why i hear lots of people say they get barely 5 hours of sot on s22u when tests like this show around 9-10 hours?
"nah he's saying the iphone battery is way smaller than the s23u and it still lasts longer, so iphone use power more efficiently"
traded it for an s22.
folding just isn't for me.
"if it fails, enjoy messing around with your fold!"
same with my note 20 ultra.
i cant use a device where i cant hide every app i barley or never use (hiding in folders isnt a option i do not want or use folders ever.
if i wanted to wirelessly charge someone else’s phone for some reason i would pull my s22 ultra out of the drawer it sits in.
if i wanted to take a picture of the moon using a phone instead of the $5k camera i have for whatever reason i would again pull my s22 ultra out of the drawer.
difference between battery life on n20u/fold 3 compared to s23u is massive actually.
there are more important things for me about the s23u than the 8k video.
note that this s22 ultra is a snapdragon 8g1 version which has about 10% less battery time than the exynos 2200 version.
note: that last sentence is mocking the generalization of op's post.
"if you have the s22 ultra, there is absolutely no sense in upgrading to the s23 ultra."
there is absolutely nothing different about the new s23.
do you realize s ultra is still a note?
any way to just make it switch to my fold 4?
"im typing from s23 ultra i bought with 1000$, just to ""try"" out why friends and society are so hyped with it."
my point is that the change from a note 20 ultra to an s23 ultra is massively less than going from the note 9 to the note 20 ultra.
but the jump from a note 20 ultra to an s23 ultra looks minimal.
just got the red s23 ultra !
"i dunno, samsung australia recently refunded my s22 ultra and a bunch of other small purchases and i didn't ask for it or send anything back."
the s22 is def a downgrade from the s10 no questions.
pixel 7 pro died while the s23 ultra had 35% left lol.
i'd rather get the pixel 7 pro and keep my s22 ultra
remember when people kept saying wait for the phone to learn your patterns when the s22u came out?
this was a week after i got the s22u.
"it’s a no wonder apples laughing all the way to the bank, counting its $3 trillion as talk about a shameless looking s23 icloud  samsung ."
just switched from the 12 pro max t9 to the fold 4.
while the upcoming iphone pro max 14 will have a better display than the s22 ultra the pro max 13 was behind both the s21 ultra and especially the s22 ultra.
bro both  i14 and s23 times are jokes.
"i ditched samsung devices after dropping my phone on freaking high pile carpet with a case and the edge of my s20 cracked, oh and my note 9 was covered in scratches by the end of that one."
a few samsung phones in india have a 6000mah battery instead of the s23u 5000mah battery.
i keep reading posts and articles about battery issues with samsung flagship devices but my almost 3 yr old note 20 ultra (snapdragon) averages 8-10+ hrs of sot still with moderate use.
i was thinking of getting a pixel 8 a while ago but i'm going to get a z flip 5 instead.
i'm guessing the people that have the s22u and can't get an upgrade don't want to believe it.
"yeah if the iphone was at 5000mah battery like the s23u, could be insane battery life."
"in my opinion, samsung is in 4 distinct positions if you categorize the market in the traditional low, mid, high and foldable market (yes, sorry for bringing this up but keep on reading and you'll see why)

#**low end**

from what i'm gathering, samsung is seeing the low end market as a game they'll inevitably lose."
(note: low end meaning the 100€ - maybe 300 € market.
"remember all the talk in the early foldable days where there was all this about form factor, possibilities and vfivdijejwpvfvf?"
you might have seen recent posts about samsung saying that ~~the foldable market~~ their foldables will overtake the s series.
"now, recall both the fact that samsung is playing a long term losing game in the traditional form factor and has a monopoly on the folding market."
"as in, deliberately making the s series, if not worse, boring enough so that the foldables will seem like perfectly good alternatives."
"i'd be surprised if this happens anytime before 2025, which is also the year the statement about foldables overtaking the s series is about."
"i've had all types of phones, an htc shadow,  galaxy s1, s2 then an lg g2, then back to a galaxy s5, then s7 then s10, then pixel 3, and now z flip 4, all to say, i think samsung was at its best in the early/middle years from the s10 onwards the galaxy lineup has been little imporvements over one another, and in the early years samsung's touchwiz was notoriously bad but the hardware was great

samsung's lineup of phones just arent what they used to be in my opinion"
