"s23 is cheaper than i14, and s23u is cheaper than i14 pro max while being just a bit pricier than i14 pro"
"i can't say i regret buying my 3 xl, and i love the playful look and behaviour of the ui, but even i know that samsung is one of the biggest driving forces behind android, so i'm very curious to see what the s23 has on offer."
"going any further doesn't do much, but given that the 10x shots on my old s10+ looked as grainy as the 30x shots on my s23u, it's still an upgrade for me."
"no, i have an s22+ and it's excellent."
any one on reddit knows that the s23 series brings just that.
i have s22u exinos and it is perfect.
"i had terrible experiences with my pixel 7 pro, and i could never accept the apple ecosystem, so i'm excited to move past the s22u issues and play with the s23u."
"they're improvements, sometimes significant improvements, that lead to the s23 ultra being a great upgrade because you're going to have a much better experience with the s23 ultra than the s22 ultra."
seems like you and the other fanboys are the ones coping since the s23 release lol
"i have the s22 ultra snapdragon, and it works well."
"i know that is only one dimension, but the performance is way better than my earlier note 10+."
i have s23 ultra and for the first time in my life it's an issue.
"nice, the s23 hype is real."
yup i used to have the s20 plus i thought that was a good phone but i wasnâ€™t crazy about the s22 ultra
i love the battery on my s23 and i came from a s20 fe which had excellent battery after the second year
"here in my country, we got first snapdragon chipset galaxy since forever on s22."
i switched to a redmi note 11 and it works fine--plus is dual sim.
"also, s22u/s23u sensors have unique features like dual iso."
"if he's coming from any other iphone, the battery on the s22u won't be disappointing to him at all."
i have fold 4.
i'll likely swap for a fold 5 just to keep that peace of mind.
i'm on like day 5 with the galaxy fold 4 and seeing similar results.
s23 line is the top of the lineâ€¦ the 14 would be the equiv of a s23 fe
when they switched to tsmc for 8gen1+ for the fold and 8gen2 for the s23 that is where they improved
i enjoy the connectivity between my phone and tablet/pc with samsung flow and notes especially.
"but it's very close, it's maybe 5% better than the s23u."
like if they went back to micro usb and put 1080p panels on the s22 ultras and it was successful.
"&#x200b;

current z fold 4 owner and enjoy it."
"the fold 4 chip was such a huge step forward in speed, cooling, efficiency, battery life."
out of 16 million foldables sold in 2022 alone.
"i do really like the colors of the s23u, though."
"i also have an original fold 5g that's still in perfect condition, the screen looks as good as it did when i got it."
fold 4 is easily on par with s22u cameras apart from lacking 10x optical zoom.
i love the mega zoom on the camera of the s22 ultra.
i have the s22 ultra and it is an amazing phone with a great camera and display i love it.
notes synced ok.
"if the s23 holds up as promised, that's worth an upgrade alone."
i have fold 4 and it has been way more durable than my s10 or 20 and i put that down to no rolled edges on screen.
"they give samsung mobile priority to the best screens, for example they used all their ltpo2 for the s22 ultra and now the 14 pros will get it"
"s23 ultra has fantastic battery life, it's their camera processing and algorithms they need to spend time on not the hardware"
in that case then yeah upgrade since the s23 ultra has a very good cooling system
my s23 ultra can run psx2 flawlessly on the largest games
like it did with s22u.
it still runs games better than s22 ultra ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
the snapdragon 8 plus gen 2 for galaxy is tailored specifically (oc'd) for the s23 line.
"i couldn't agree more, i got the first curved screen on the note 4 edge years ago, and had curved screens since then."
"i'm very happy they kept it on the s22 ultra, and i hope it's still gonna be this way when i'll jave to change it."
i'll say my s23 does 8k and i've had no issues.
the s23 ultra is a much better phone than the s22 ultra.
got to laugh at the people on this thread not wanting to believe there's an improvement with the s23u despite the fact the geekerwan tests show there's a massive efficiency improvement with the 8gen2.
this is the first time i seriously considered switching to iphone (after getting the s22+)
mine gets hot too and i have the s22 ultra.
kinda like the design on the s22+ more
"i used samsung phones since s2 untill 3 months ago when i bought the s22 ultra, it was so bad for such an expensive phone with massive lags and stutters and heat and bad battery life, sold it and got the 13 pro max and i am extremely happy and satisfied with it."
"if it is facing up, i need to pick it up and flip it to hold it properly."
"not sure about exynos, but snapdragon s22 ultra is amazing."
"i have a iphone 13pro, pixel 6 and pixel 6 pro, s21 and s22 ultra along with some others, and out of all of them the s21 ultra and s22 ultra are easily the best."
i specifically got my s22+ just because it didn't have the curved screen.
i don't know if it's the same but my flip2's screen got a crack in the crease 8 months in.
"not sure if the s22 series is any better, or what the s23 will bring, but when it comes to software, optimisation trumps features all day every day and at the minute, apple has nailed it."
"specs aside, i really like the design of the s23s compared to the s21s."
"they're not easy to use, like in notes i have to hold to place the cursor to edit, but it's still [usable](https://i."
"iphone 13 pro max is ranked 1st on dxo mark, the s22 ultra is 6th and the s21 13th"
base s22 here.
"all my pass are synced thanks to knox, i do share notes between tab and phone, i switch simultaneously from one device to the other with the watch, and i don't even need to download an app that needs to be always opened in background."
i've got a decent exynos s22u.
excited to see some more comparisons with the base s23.
samsung s23 and a54 use the same battery but the s23 lasts longer while being much faster and having a higher quality screen.
"i love the good ol' slab design, love my s23u."
i love my fold 4 use it daily for work.
the fold is definitely an upgrade in most every way.
my girlfriend got the flip 4.
"i have a fold, tab 7, and i've been a samsung guy since the note 4."
"look at the difference in camera quality in the s22u between the snapdragon and exynos version, the exynos version had a different isp and had a different quality."
with the s23 it just has a superior ability to process multiple exposures on the fly to produce a better instant result.
it is one generation behind those use in galaxy fold or ultra.
my s23 ultra has great battery life.
"the s23u has one of the best mainstream flagship battery life now, only beaten by a few gaming phones with 6000mah batteries."
thatâ€™s a massive improvement from s23u.
probably like 30% improvement from s22+ to s23+
"besides the incredible efficiency gains by sd8g2, i can also comfortably say after trying out the s23 series for a decent amount of time, ""one ui 5."
"looks like the s22+, i'm so excited"
this year samsung is very close with video quality thanks to powerfull soc in s23.
"my s23 non ultra can take a pretty good photo of the moon with the 3x camera, but the 10x looks really good."
"every upgrade you just mentioned from your note 9 to note 20 ultra is the same as every upgrade you'd get moving the the s23 ultra but probably not as noticeable, like both have 120hz but the s23 will still be smoother, faster and brighter."
fold or flip 5 is definitely in my future.
i am currently using s22+ and i am sharing my own experience.
"in fact, this year the iphone 14 pro will have a newer display than the s22 ultra, which is a first."
that said samsung offers all price ranges from low end to high end and on top of it foldable.
foldables is where you can look to for innovation.
"the z-fold 5 looks to be a real big improvement over the 4 based on the leaks, thinner, lighter, less of a crease, wider front screen, etc."
"idc much about all that, just give me $1000 for my s22u and im a happy man."
holy shit this affirms my p/o should be a huge upgrade form my 86% health s22+
"i have only just seen the reply i do game quite a bit on my phone, i'm quite a heavy user but my s22 couldn't handle most of what i did it would lag just going on instagram, i ended up going mod range and getting an a52s and it's been pretty good so far with no issues"
i used the s22 ultra and itâ€™s okay but i find myself liking the older samsung phones from 2019 and 2020 better.
i just prefer the overall vibe of the note 10 plus or 20 ultra but i like the camera of the 10 the best.
funny enough the smartthings app on my iphone works better with my smartthings enabled appliances than my galaxy fold 4 and galaxytab s8+ do.
hope the s22u is okay.
no the vivo x fold has a much larger and more importantly wider outer screen.
"in fact, i'm typing this out on my opened fold 4 and i'm still amazed."
"i had an exynos s22 ultra, did not have this major issues but i was very dissapointed, it felt like i was using a 5yr old phone and ip13 pro is just amazing."
i have no regrets getting the s22+
but it gets rid of the s22u cooling issue.
the s23 needs a camera update or 2 and then it will be good to go
"personally i'll gladly charge my s22 more than once per day because i love the form factor, design, speed, elegance and speed."
"as a person that uses both an iphone 13 and an s22 ultra, i prefer my s22 ultra in most daily things."
then iphone camera's got better and beat the competition up until the s21 and s22 series where samsung took over again.
the 13 pro max has a better screen than the s22 ultra
the s23u just happens to have fantastic battery apparently
"okâ€¦ well price alone, iphone 14 pro is the same price as s23plusâ€¦ and it comes with a way better processorâ€¦ and smokes it in performance."
"the s23 is truly, one of the phones ever made."
samsung note 5.
i think the s23u will be by far their best phone yet.
"i understand every release should be their best phone yet, but i do think in 3 months when those reviews come out it will show that it's a much more complete and still 8 rounded device than the s22 ultra"
they literally did with the s23 series
my flip 4 is doing amazing so far.
i'm probably going fold 5 next year because of how amazing this phone is.
"the jump from a note 9 to a 20 ultra (two years apart) felt pretty huge, because you went from 6 4"" display to a 6."
i'm interested in the s23u.
i tried using the ipad as my only ios device when i got a fold 3 but apple has really made iphone the fulcrum around which their entire ecosystem operates.
i now have s23 and i still shower with it.
i'd say folding touchscreen phones are pretty innovative.
"#**foldables**

and here's the wild card."
"yeah, look at the fold 4/flip 4 and what they actually are."
if you want a foldable in europe and north america.
you have the fold and the flip.
i could finally get a flip and see what the hype is about.
the other alternative is that they know something will happen that will boost the interest in foldables and we all know that this is apple entering the market.
