screen capture: part of the edge panel it helps with lot of advanced things like grabing text out of screenshots.
it has a bigger battery than the 14p but the 14p smaller screen really makes the difference.
the screens are physically fine.
there's nothing wrong with preferring a curved screen.
"i also have an original fold 5g that's still in perfect condition, the screen looks as good as it did when i got it."
this actually looks way better than the edge display which hinders any side gesture so much some times and just screen protectors in general.
"second it has a larger battery (4500 instead of 4000 on the regular s21) and the screen is a tat bigger (6,4 inch instead of 6."
0 never pagged with the screen full of zombie horde.
i have fold 4 and it has been way more durable than my s10 or 20 and i put that down to no rolled edges on screen.
"they give samsung mobile priority to the best screens, for example they used all their ltpo2 for the s22 ultra and now the 14 pros will get it"
"i love it, i mostly use it to : 

-enable screen rotation for media apps."
you are right that there is only a small difference to be seen on phones but on screens / tv it is clearly visible.

"i couldn't agree more, i got the first curved screen on the note 4 edge years ago, and had curved screens since then."
"great screen, great camera, awesome battery life."
"to be fair, if the 7 pro's screen is the same as the 6 pro my wife had, that's still a very nice display."
i specifically got my s22+ just because it didn't have the curved screen.
i don't know if it's the same but my flip2's screen got a crack in the crease 8 months in.
"with that i got a bigger brighter screen, 120hz refresh, better battery life, great performance, pretty much the same camera system that they are still using today, and it still has expandable storage."
samsung s23 and a54 use the same battery but the s23 lasts longer while being much faster and having a higher quality screen.
"the issue is not with the performance, its with the screen swipe sensitivity"
there’s no damage to the screens.
"alternative title: ""80% of the iphone 14s screens will be good"""
i also love the curved screen.
"in the case of a display all apple is doing is providing their requirements, and all samsung is doing is taking an existing tech they developed, make sure it meets those requirements and send them out in the right screen resolution and size."
"the z-fold 5 looks to be a real big improvement over the 4 based on the leaks, thinner, lighter, less of a crease, wider front screen, etc."
"what he means is that on ios, once you leave an app, it takes a screenshot of the app and shows it to you once you open it again so you think the app was still running in the background."
"good lock, samsung fllow, all kinds of ways to use second screen, link share/quick share, multi control,  and so on."
no the vivo x fold has a much larger and more importantly wider outer screen.
"steady hand (or some support), and clicking on the screen to get the light adjustment right are the most important."
the 13 pro max has a better screen than the s22 ultra
"i was happy with the service, because they replaced the screen at no cost."
"surprisingly, the samsung pc screen in my bedroom works much better."
i love curved screens since the galaxy s6 edge.
you can also start screen recording which will lock to 120hz and see the difference.
i loved my ipod back in the day blue lcd screen and red button lights version.
"basic phone features is decent battery, decent screen, can call people, won’t break in a month, can use internet."
"if you have your screen replaced by apple, they will ensure that it is correctly sealed."
"i had great screen on time with a mix of wifi at home, 5g at work and crappy signal at work too."
i'd say folding touchscreen phones are pretty innovative.
