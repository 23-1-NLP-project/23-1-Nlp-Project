the thing about samsung is not in the amoled screen or the processor n stuff.
"yeah i don't have that issue either, even with a screen protector"
i've had it for 4 years of drops and spills and i've still yet to even see my screen crack.
the 7 pro is using a really old screen  as well.
i'd say the bigger screen is a downside
there is twitter screen showing 5:30 for s23u.
my phone won’t boot and samsung have checked the phone claiming the screens don’t work.
because one person could be on tik tok for 4 hours while someone else has their phone locked and screen off for those 4 hours.
and there is this infamous screen dead problem on the s21+ where the phone can be charged n still can be turned on but the screen is dead.
but the better phone s23 ultra will get that shittastic curved screen.
"nothing i ever did, the screens would just stop working/responding to touch."
i just came back to samsung after using a pixel and that at-a-glance widget being stuck up at the top of the main screen was mindblowing.
"also a wqhd+ screen with a max brightness of 1,750 nits (the brightest smartphone screen)."
i also enable the one-touch routine on homescreen where i have presets routines that i tap when i want to activated.
"i also enable the one-touch routine on the home screen where i have preset routines that i tap when i want to activate like meetings, do-not-disturb, party, etc."
saying the screens need replacing.
the screen had a crack in the screen and fell for he samsung hype.
how different is the screen feel over a longer period of time?
i got to tried both in a shop today for a bit and the screen protector on the flip seemed quite a bit less pleasant than the naked screens of s22+ or the new iphones
a screen replacement costs me like $50.

yes and i agree, problem is: i was not diving, i got a splash of water, i wasn't submerging the phone, before i sent my phone for repair i was told the phone would be back to it's original specifications included the ip68 rating which as the screen capture from their website clearly shows that the phone shouldn't get any water inside as the phone has no cracks, dents or any damage, the manager at the place where they (samsung) sent me to get it checked said ""the phone was not properly repaired by samsung technicians."
i took it to service down the street you fix break whatever and they told me that samsung told them that they wouldn't pay for any replacement of screens of flips.
he tried to blame a nick on the screen protector as the reason why i had gotten a dead spot.
they tried to replace the screen but at first they said there were no parts and then they just said that something had gone wrong.
i'm pretty sure it's refurbished it looks fine but honestly i'm sitting here concerned about how long the screen is going to last and whether i should get care plus or some kind of insurance because i trusted the product and i shouldn't.
"if the front screen is wider i would consider going back to using it, the inner screen was amusing and great but the thin front screen became very tiring to type on and use in a daily basis."
"my s10+ stopped working few weeks after warranty ended, screen turned greeen and wasn't responding, my s21+ went on check with samsung, because it got so hot it wasn't possible to hold it on face druing call and it never came back from repair and s22u has bad battery and reception."
"i have a fold 4, a tv, the widescreen 34in oled monitor, a tab s8 ultra and a fold 4."
"about 4 hours screen on time, 2:15 of which was video from youtube on the inner screen."
it's silly to me that their answer is a screen replacement for a firmware issue.
try calling them and explaining the phone isn't for a screen repair.
no one even has an 8k screen to support it.
"i don't hate the phone but i hate that a product lacking in basic features like usb c, file management , split screen  is popular."
"in terms of hardware, my screen came with microscratches out the box."
"i was replying to someone who said :

>""ios takes a screenshot of your app and shows it to you once you reopen it""  

which is just objectively not true,"
"the screens are designed to survive 200,000 folds, around 100 times a day for five years."
i've used several curved screen phones and i definitely prefer a flat screen.
i think most people have used curved screens and prefer a flat screen.
"i had an s8 and it  is the only phone i ever broke the screen on, because i couldn't find a glass screen protector that worked well."
"i am clumsy and always have a glass screen protector, and on average go through about 3-4 of them per phone, so it's a must have."
"i’m on iphone, but all the discussion can be stopped at the point where we don’t have split screen apps and proper picture in picture for youtube."
samsung are basically pretending there is no issue with the device and just stating the screens need replacing which is just complete horseshit.
"you have to put it down on the screen, which inscreases the chance that it scratches, only to see some coded light flickering."
you have a damn screen on the other side that can show exactly what you need to know about who is calling or what type of message you got.
it's not actually samsung displays sure samsung manufactures them however it's apple who actually designs the specs of the panels apple simply doesn't have the ability to make their own screens so they pay samsung to do for them but they are still apple displays
"i had a oneplus 7 pro since launch but it's microphone started having problems, battery life was lasting 3hrs of screen on time (7 screen off), 

i purchased the s22 ultra exynos at black friday hoping that as it was one of the most expensive android phones out there it would be great but i was very disappointed; battery life was not that good, speakers were awfull compared to op7 pro's (sounding like a cheap tiny 5$ chinese speaker), screen colours were not customizable as much as on oneplus and in my eyes red tones looked ""muddy""/""too soft"", video was very bad especially when using social media apps such as insta for story as zooming in was very laggy, there was a lot of noise (blue noise with artifacts) even at day in some scenarios."
"i therefore returned the s22 ultra after 2 weeks but few weeks ago my oneplus front camera stopped working so i ordered the s23 ultra

i now had the s23 ultra for 3 days, and speaker really got improved, sounding a bit better that the oneplus,  screen is the same so still red tones too muddy in my opinion and not enough screen colours customisation, for video the noise issue got solved, noise is nowhere near as bad in video and camera switching in social media apps is not as laggy as on s22 ultra, i still prefer the colours of videos on the op7 pro, which look more pleasing to the eyes and the fact that photos are more natural looking on op7 pro with less oversharpening and better colours."
"i get only 4-5 hours of screen on time with the s23 ultra with qhd+, 120hz variable refresh rate and auto brightness, same setting (90hz) with brand new oneplus after release was giving me 7-8hrs of screen on time which was way better, hope this is just because battery didn't addapt to my usage yet or an update will fix it."
"you can see your phones screen directly on the tablet and move it around like a window, you can even take a video call from your phone, on your tablet and use the camera on your tablet like if you were directly on the phone."
"yeah i agree the swap won't be as noticeable but i personally think you underestimate the difference for example the s23 ultra comes with a new 200mp camera, has a much brighter screen, much more powerful chip(especially if you're in europe) and much better battery life, i'm going from the s21 ultra to the s23 ultra mostly for battery life and chip performance especially as i'm in uk and have a shitty exynos chip plus i've never had a note so i'm excited to have an s pen and boxed shaped phone"
"the only thing i could see is if you like to do split screen, but i can’t tell you the last time i’ve done that on my android phones."
"it could open an app and do a task in that app with only 1 command, and it had access to the samsung settings, and if you wanted to find a setting you could just tell bixby to do it, like set screen off time to 10 minutes, or clear trash in gallery, it could even shut down or restart the phone."
my phone won’t boot and samsung have checked the phone claiming the screens don’t work.
"instead the should do a phone with a low quality camera, bo front camera and insain screen and battery life instead."
"first days with my s23u the battery lasted 18 h with 1 charge and the sot was 10h (with little light gaming) and screen off 8h, but 2 weeks from that (right now) i feel that something changed and battery dont last too much like before,  im barely obtaining 7-6h sot and if i play some game it drains like 5 to 8% in 10 minutes."
flat screens look weird to me now
but here's one about screen burn in: https://thedroidguy.
com/how-to-fix-screen-burn-in-or-discoloration-on-samsung-galaxy-s8-1095095
"it doesn't have major wear, those are just bad poctures i took with my sports camera but the phkme is at best 9/10, minor scuffs on screen a d minor scuffs on the bezel, no cracks no dents."
"first minor thing

nothing wrong with navigation besides the lack of a universal back button and being able to swipe from the right of the screen to go back."
"my friend also had problems with her fold 3, after 3 or so months the screen started to crack in the middle and leak black shit, took her 4 months of fighting both her telco and samsung before they replaced it."
the largest manufacturer of small oled screens will provide iphone oled screens?
it’s one of my gripes as i hate to reach to the top of the screen to hit the ‘x’ button.
i got a mazda last year and android auto didn’t fill the screen completely.
and to even have a screen protector replaced would be a 2 wk turn around.
i prefer screen facing down (i use a cover).
"aside from the fact that an s22 is a very small phone and, i would think, a bigger screen gives a much better gaming experience."
i went through 3 s10+ screens before i said fuck it and bought a s10e.
"even with otterbox cases, the curved screen is fragile."
its all the same top of the line class with a smaller screen.
most of the apps don't work so well if open in split screen like my fold.
also they're fucking terrible to navigate in tiny smashed form it's like trying to use the cover screen.
"nexus 4 - overheating, yellow screen."
"honestly i agree, the curved screen was a massive selling point for me when i switched to samsung in 2015 and it's a bummer it's all but gone."
don't like ios honestly but at least the phone doesn't get set on fire whenever i do anything then proceeds to throttle itself to 60hz while having 5 hours screen on time
9-10 hours of screen on time.
"the s21 only having a 1080p screen, plus no sd card really pissed me off!"
"as for your notes, take screenshots of them and copy and paste the notes and send them to yourself via email."
"but people were talking about adaptive battery like ""it needs to learn your patterns"" for weeks after launch like it was going to give you a 2-3hr screen on time boost later down the road."
my one complaint about curved screens is when i'm trying to select things right below the curve with the s pen.
do you mean the screen protector?
"we've had issues with some purchases on their website and sent them a fuckton of details how it's not working, including request dumps and screenshots, and their response was ""it works for me so it's not our issue""."
"as someone with an iphone 14 pro max, i do get this screen on time sometimes less but im on 5g ultra wideband the whole day and it’s not the strongest signal."
"they:

* make it easier for the screen to break as the curved glass is a bigger stress point if the phone is dropped."
* make it so that glass screen protectors are a massive pain in the ass to install.
this makes is so the s-pen gets caught and drags on the screen.
"i end up replacing mine about every three weeks since i have t-mobile's insurance on mine and that comes with free screen protector replacement) and aren't exactly easy to install, use a glass protector that only has adhesive on the sides and requires a massive circle for the fingerprint reader to kinda function, or a complicated install process that requires the user to drop glue on their phone's display and cure it with a uv light."
* make it so that screen repairs are more expensive.
otherwise i can not see my screen.
i'm very used to the curved screen and barely notice it.
the screen protector problem was an issue until i found the perfect one that fit.
i also had to find a case that didn't peel the screen protector off.
"&#x200b;

>nothing wrong with navigation besides the lack of a universal back button and being able to swipe from the right of the screen to go back."
"take the youtube app, or when you open a video/photo from the reddit app, or when you get a fullscreen ad that you cant see the close button of."
i can only assume since it gets stuck in a boot loop they haven’t diagnosed the firmware issue and are just saying both screens magically need replacing at the same time.
considering there is no damage to either screen it’s hilariously incompetent.
"android competition with: 

-the best amoled panels (they build/sell panels to their competition but keep their best for themselves)

‐the longest and punctual software support (this is where lg ate shit & also where samy took a shot at daddy google lol)

‐stoopid lucrative trade-in promos & screen replacement service

‐proactive in hardware revisions (re-signing with tsmc thru 2030 to make their flagship socs when they'd finally realize their in-house made sd888 & sd8gen1 are ""flaming"" dogshit, arguably)

‐chokeholding their own fanbase (they don't give af about removing the sdcard, headphone jack, included charging bricks, or your feelings about those moves."
but which company now *officially* allows you to replace your screen or battery yourself?
the leds in the top half of the screen started bleeding and blackening unprovoked.
the screen has been replaced once already and is going bad again.
i've been using it for three months now and if i don't have battery saver on it simply will not last from 6 am to 6 pm with 2 hours tops of screen on time
"and before anyone tells me about the lock screen updates, i want to say that on an average i guys a person doesn't spend much time on the lockscreen."
"but then, i don't use a screen protector."
"but if you're evidence are the picture of your phone with foggy camera and a screenshot from their website, then i don't think it would be a good battle."
battery time 9+ hours of screen on time / lasts 2 days.
"*

you give the ai a completely white screen, the ai won't put a moon there."
"i base my case in the following screen capture taken from samsung website and what the meaning of ip68 truly means, not what i think it means, they lied to me in different occasions, they told me in the begining that i sent my phone because it wasn't powering on, that's a lie, i sent it for a broken screen the first time they repaired it and i have the records, then after on another call they told me that in this claim the phone had a broken screen a d that totally made me go mad because my phone had no cracks, no dents, no scratches and somehow they're telling me the screen is broken?"
i'm waitimg tk get my phne back and if indeed has a broken screen i'm gonna get rrally upset about it as the phone was inspected by ups and if indeed jas a broken screen then i have to go against ups.
"the camera ,120hz screen and build quality are better tho."
that doesn't mean it's copying from those other similar situations or grabbing some other screenshot and inserting it into those pixels instead.
i really doubt you have never dropped a phone and a case does fuck all if you drop the phone on its screen.
"if you take a picture of a blurry computer screen with a white circle on a black sky and get a nice picture of the moon, do you really think that's no different than what any other phone does?"
and then pixel owners complain about bloatware which largely can be removed (completely with adb) but are ok with this unremovable screen estate stealing junk?
"because you will not notice any difference between 4k and 8k on a phone, laptop, or tv screen."
it's not tho apple designs their screens samsung lg ect simply manufacture them
it took me a bit to hook my phone up to my samsung tv for screen share but i do appreciate the smart things app and i hope it's less clunky than my first s22 ultra linking experience (had to download the driver/app for my tv and it kept failing).
yeah the vivo fold looks so good the fact that the fold 4 is going to have the same smaller outer screen is complete trash
the stupid home screen widget that you can't get rid of.
even little things i took for granted like being able to place home screens to the left of the main one were sorely missed.
i love having a main home screen and being able to swipe to other screens to the right and left of it - and stock android doesn't allow for that.
almost flat screen ?
screenshot of the temps: https://i.
these tests are on wifi and constant screen on.
share here screenshots of battery usage and sot
they supply the screens half the damn time.
i want a bigger outer screen.
agent just kept trying to end the conversation and basically said the watch 4 is worthless because it's a screen issue and it's almost a year old now.
i mean s23u had like 25% more screen resolution yet only 15% more battery and still matched the iphone 14 pro max in battery life
"apple's got really strict hardware quality control for screens, and the boe/lg oleds they've used in the past were mostly indistinguishable from samsung's (in fact, the lg ones had better viewing angles)"
i'm not a giant curved screen guy.
but i must admit a non curved screen feels very foreign to me.
so what ur saying is then apple contracts samsung to make the screens and apple then gives the dimentions ect but samsung makes them
how do you expect google to stop samsung from selling screens to apple?
"without screens, apple can't build iphones."
"it's desgined to last 5 years, built in screen protector might need replacing every now and then, samsung should replace for free."
"yep i have broken exactly one screen in my life, and it was on an s8 that couldn't have a glass protector."
"every other phone has been flat, gets dropped all the time, and the glass screen protector does its job."
the your phone app shows you your message on the pc screen even in full screen games and can reply there
yeah the vivo fold looks so good the fact that the fold four is going to have the same smaller outer screen is complete trash
"but have to admit, i sometimes wish my s22 ultra is a flat screen."
"i understand what you said but hear me out: my phone is a s22 ultra, i cracked the screen, then before i sent my phone i asked them if the phone was gonna be back to it's original specifications, that includes the ip68 rating which by their own website states: 1."
"yes, apple will get the m12 oled, but samsung still prioritizes itself, otherwise the 13 pros would've gotten the 1-120hz screen we're getting this year"
ofc the battery drains also when the screen isn't on but there is now way the difference is this big in one day of usage right?
very efficient cpu and much less screen resolution
"my s20+ display is fucked, i've not turned on that phone in months, hopefully i got enough money to buy a new screen, it hasn't forced me to update once."
"my a71 has a touchscreen problem after i dropped it on the road at 40km/h in a motorcycle, it still works but i can no longer play games on this, only social media, it has also not forced me to update once."
my battery is okay but the screen has developed a dark rectangle type  spot in the center going up to the top.
"i got a ipod touch after a while (pre smart phone days) and while it was fun enough, when they forced the newsstand app on my home screen i never forgave them for it."
"and a screen without the pwm flicker making people sick, giving headaches and eye strain."
"8"" display, went from 60hz to 120hz, went from a rear fingerprint to under screen, went from a forehead and chin to near bezel-less and a pin hole for selfie camera, gained 5g antenna, went from dual 12mp camera system to dual 12mp and a 108mp zoom lens, plus all of the usual upgrades."
"very similar design, similar screen to body ratio, similar pinhole camera cutout, same refresh/resolution, similar camera system, etc."
"double storage base model

better selfie and main camera

flatter edges make screen less curved, better for spen

excited to try the astro photo stuff."
is there a specific pressure you put on screen to open it correctly?
that screenshot you're talking about included the initial setup.
that being said it's really hard to prepare a screen that's already been cracked and prevent it from being waterproof.
is your iphone still waterproof once the screen has been replaced?
"may 31, 2022


my brother had his iphone screen cracked and he placed it and he asked about what would happen if it was in the water?"
"fast forward to now, ieave work and by 6pm i'm under 50% we with like 2hrs 30 min screen time, 11hrs screen off time."
"regardless, these screenshots are meaningless at this point."
and even bigger pita to install a tempered glass screen protector.
