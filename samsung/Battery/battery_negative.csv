those who depend on their devices that much do not take chances with the battery life.
"for a $1100+ phone, i would hate to have to bring a battery pack for it."
you have some battery tests on youtube
no way adaptive battery will take sot from 5:30 to 11:15.
you can fix it i remember reading a thing it does it to save battery and most apps you wouldn't notice but if you are playing cod or some shit where quick precise aiming is needed it'll screw ya.
stay away from the base s22 since the battery is cheeks.
who says u gotta get the s23 compared to the pixel 7 pro when a midrange samsung has these batteries + a midrange cpu for additional battery savings.
you sound like the rest of the idiots that said a replaceable battery is the stupidest thing.
just carry a much bigger and inconvenient battery bank!
s22's below average battery is one of its biggest con.
"apparently some stuff smart switch carries over can unintentionally mess with stuff in the device at the time of the restore, so either not even using smart switch, or at least resetting the settings, can help with the battery."
"i wish the camera, battery/charging specs would improve dramatically."
how is your battery life mate?
they ought to make their battery physically denser
"what new battery tech is apple and samsung doing, now?"
"there is no way to show ""real life"" battery test."
so obviously one phone would have more battery drain.
"even after a couple of weeks, the battery life was so horrid (i could literally see the percentages dropping before me eyes), never stood at 120hz much closer to 60hz, and got pretty hot doing the smallest stuff."
"there’s major issues on this side too, but battery life and performance aren’t."
"disagree, cameras are already really good, but are not a day to day thing for the vast majority of people, battery however impacts every single person using the phones."
"here, samsung finally manages to catch up, but they are still fully limited to whatever qualcomm does, since bigger capacity battery is physically impossible to fit, unless new standard gets developed of course."
i bought s22 plus and have been plagued by battery woes.
"maybe not, but apparently battery life is comparable to the iphone 14 pro max."
yeah i'm not sure how people run out of battery throughout the day.
like you have to be playing games on 4k full brightness to be draining your battery in 12 hours.
"if he's coming from the latest iphone where apple beefed up battery life because of battery complaints in their last few iterations, sure."
"its gotten old now, but even since i first got it, the battery was never good."
"battery life is going to leave you disappointed and it is a big, heavy phone"
does the flip 4 battery get you through the day easily?
"all samsung phones have decent battery life for one year, then you begin to struggle and for the second year you are looking to upgrade to the next galaxy, thinking maybe sammy this time really fixed the battery."
"my last galaxy was an s10, battery health said it’s in”good” condition but it barely stand up to 2-3pm with mid use."
"i actually get pretty great battery life, but some days i hyperfocus and can't pry my phone from my eyeballs."
"the samsung galaxy with exynos is objectively worse than snapdragon including battery life, performance, thermal etc."
of course i’ve never seen any lags or stutters on this thing and the battery life is mad.
the only way to kill this battery fast is games at full brightness.
"my s10+ stopped working few weeks after warranty ended, screen turned greeen and wasn't responding, my s21+ went on check with samsung, because it got so hot it wasn't possible to hold it on face druing call and it never came back from repair and s22u has bad battery and reception."
"i swore, s22u would be my last samsung, yet here i am thinking about s23u, but until i see solid reviews and all people praising battery, i won't buy a thing."
currently sitting at 48% battery.
"even that, they reduced the battery sizs and still heating issues (according to people complaining in /r/galaxys22"
"although the app could use some optimizing i think because it seems to run quite heavy, leading to a substantial increase in temperature and the battery drains as if the bottom fell out, atleast on my z flip3."
"and back to the ipad camera, small not to high quality, and use as much space as possible on battery alone."
i never got booted out of apps and i always got 1 day battery life.
they have a much smaller battery.
and the fact that the battery died within 6-9 hours if i was actively or moderately using the device meant that i had to constantly be charging it.
"as it stands with the s23u, i'd take better cameras than better battery tech (or soc efficiency), if i had to pick one."
you haven't saw any xiaomi 13 battery test vids online?
i wonder where is my 9:45 hours of sot on my super adapted battery then.
my tiktok/reddit addiction is not good for the battery life on my s22u.
bixby also audibly tells me with words when my battery is low and runs an alarm (set timer for 30 seconds when battery is full) when it's done changing which helps me as i also have adhd and would either never charge my phone or just leave it plugged in previously.
they research on so many battery technologies for a long time it's only a question when they will release them
"the phone is either defective or you're using 5g, i never use 5g because it turns my phone into a furnace and obliterates battery life"
my reddit app barely uses any of my battery.
the ultra have had 5000mah batteries since that line was introduced and with the s23+ getting better battery life than the 23u it's time to increase that.
i’ll try turning off 5g and see if i get better battery and somewhat decent phone reception.
"honestly, i wouldn't mind a thicker phone, to get a 6,000 or even 7,000 mah battery in the s24 ultra"
s22 has terrible battery life.
samsung wishing apple can share their battery tech and optimization.
"i had a oneplus 7 pro since launch but it's microphone started having problems, battery life was lasting 3hrs of screen on time (7 screen off), 

i purchased the s22 ultra exynos at black friday hoping that as it was one of the most expensive android phones out there it would be great but i was very disappointed; battery life was not that good, speakers were awfull compared to op7 pro's (sounding like a cheap tiny 5$ chinese speaker), screen colours were not customizable as much as on oneplus and in my eyes red tones looked ""muddy""/""too soft"", video was very bad especially when using social media apps such as insta for story as zooming in was very laggy, there was a lot of noise (blue noise with artifacts) even at day in some scenarios."
"also if you use bereal, there is some issues with the front camera where there is nothing but noise in dark conditions, like the output looks like a 100$ phone at night on bereal (when taking selfies with other social media or camera app that issue is not there so hoping for a fix)

however it's been 3 days now and battery life is not really good, better than on oneplus obviously but i charge it 2 times a day, where i charged my oneplus 4 times a day."
"i get only 4-5 hours of screen on time with the s23 ultra with qhd+, 120hz variable refresh rate and auto brightness, same setting (90hz) with brand new oneplus after release was giving me 7-8hrs of screen on time which was way better, hope this is just because battery didn't addapt to my usage yet or an update will fix it."
i allready have my s10 in mint condition but the battery is getting worse and i dont want to have a phone with a swapped battery.
"in the case of the 7 pro, i think a pro to its battery is that the camera doesn’t drain the phone as bad as samsung, apple, and other camera apps on phones do."
"yeah i agree the swap won't be as noticeable but i personally think you underestimate the difference for example the s23 ultra comes with a new 200mp camera, has a much brighter screen, much more powerful chip(especially if you're in europe) and much better battery life, i'm going from the s21 ultra to the s23 ultra mostly for battery life and chip performance especially as i'm in uk and have a shitty exynos chip plus i've never had a note so i'm excited to have an s pen and boxed shaped phone"
"i would never use a watch that has a 1 day battery though, so i can't benefit from that."
it's very difficult to drastically increase battery life at this moment without either just putting in a larger battery or major strides in mainstream battery innovation which there isn't yet really
obviously over time battery life starts to degrade
"i have similar problems, the battery drains way too fast, i shouldve gone with realme gt 2 for significantly less $ and better battery and better charging ( plus a charger )"
i got with max battery saving at best 7h sot and even then feels it's draining
"the battery effect is probably very much placebo, nfc is incredibly low power."
"4g only devices may get more battery life but they also aren't the newest, fastest, & most efficient modems."
"any of this ""all day"" battery life stuff is just lazy."
"be it with an external charger pack or otherwise

i am all for improvements in battery, charging, & efficiency tech, i'm just not so sure it's so much of an issue for any modern phone."
"instead the should do a phone with a low quality camera, bo front camera and insain screen and battery life instead."
"first days with my s23u the battery lasted 18 h with 1 charge and the sot was 10h (with little light gaming) and screen off 8h, but 2 weeks from that (right now) i feel that something changed and battery dont last too much like before,  im barely obtaining 7-6h sot and if i play some game it drains like 5 to 8% in 10 minutes."
battery life was why i actually gave up on samsung phones.
"haven't been happy with the s22, bad battery life, and always running hot."
"unfortunately i fell into the trap, my battery started dying on my s10+ which is less than ideal and got a deal on the s22+ including trading in all i paid was $380~ and i still think it's not worth it."
"1 to ufs 4
- significantly better battery life
- improved haptics
- improved microphone
- improved speaker sound quality
- stronger glass with gorilla glass victus 2
- possible addition of satellite connectivity later this year
- display color quality improvements with vision booster

there is probably more that i've forgotten"
takes a lot of battery to exfiltrate all of your data back to china.
i have a 8 plus from apple with better battery life then the ultra and it’s an older phone too
"be/yok_wszgnma

battery life."
nothing comes close to the battery king 13 pro max.
"the only three  major differences is better battery life, better night mode and better speakers."
i'd pay $400 over msrp for a special model with a larger battery.
and it would be better for the overall health of the battery -- charging to only 85% would get you basically a current 100% worth of charge.
magsafe case with attachable magnetic qi charger just adds a whole level of thickness a bigger internal battery wouldn't come remotely close to.
give us back the thickness of 3-4yrs ago and slap a massive battery in!
but it's about how long they can keep up that battery life too.
how well the battery degrades.
"if you can't get off of your phone for 30 minutes to charge it, you have bigger problems than worrying about your phone's battery life."
"even with the s23u i end a heavy day with less than 30% battery, so if i forget to charge it during the night it could become a problem the next day."
pretty sure battery tech has always been slower than camera improvements.
killed the battery obviously.
phone would shutdown when battery showed 35%.
i can indeed confirm that the battery is kinda cheeks.
"phone-battery swell, tv-horizontal lines starts appearing after just 5 years, fridge-countless repairs and problems with fan,cooling etc, washing machine-breakdown)."
"plus i thought the battery would be better, it's worse!"
how’s the battery on that s22+?
"but people were talking about adaptive battery like ""it needs to learn your patterns"" for weeks after launch like it was going to give you a 2-3hr screen on time boost later down the road."
now imagine if android phones were aggressive like ios with battery management
"my smart watch sees that i am asleep and that the phone is charging > activates battery protection (85% limit)

3."
s23 ultra goes neck to neck with iphone 14 pro max and the dude be complaining about the battery capacity 💀.
i'd rather have a solid battery lasting 3 years and not bloating
my battery can already last me two days.
well 5g kills alote battery and yet mine 13 pro max never had less then 9h ost and that was because of the dsmn 5g.
"i pre ordered s22+ and it was fine the first 2 months and then it just went down hill, battery is shit have to charge it half way through my day and i have a long list of apps that i have put in deep sleep."
the battery life on the s23u is rumored to be a game changer on par with 14 pro max.
with the s22u you are constantly looking at the battery meter all day long fearing it will run out.
would rather have one as a sd card slot than have double sim which just drains more battery and no one uses anyway.
>yeah i'm not sure how people run out of battery throughout the day.
but which company now *officially* allows you to replace your screen or battery yourself?
"samsung has just caught back up to the s21's battery capacities, they need to do more."
i have not tried the s22 series so i cannot comment on the battery life but my a73 is a battery beast.
this is actually one of the reasons why i downgraded from the s21 to the a73(my s21 had terrible battery life).
"battery life is so important, the days i'm not charged up are the days i'm on vacation or out drinking and need me phone."
finallyi have it set to slow charge and only charge up to 85% at night so if i leave it plugged in overnight it's less tough on the battery.
"same and i stream music for 12hours + a day and i have battery protect on, so it starts at 85% lol"
a guy in my company still uses his iphone 5s with a new battery.
"if the one glaring weakness on the 22 was battery and the main weakness was fixed the next year, why wouldn't you want the newer model?"
exynos always heating which will result in a quick throttling then poor battery life.
and in  s22 series samsung reduced the battery capacity (only ultra model) still uses the same huge battery.
battery degrades enough in about 2½ yrs to compel u to buy a new phone.
"in my country, india, it's not easy to get a genuine battery replacement & get it fixed without losing the water proofing."
actually incredible how shitty the battery life is.
i've been using it for three months now and if i don't have battery saver on it simply will not last from 6 am to 6 pm with 2 hours tops of screen on time
"no masked face id for iphone 11, no landscape faceld for iphone 11, no battery percentage for iphone 11."
efficiency doesnt mean the same thing as total battery life.
"only getting 4-5h on a full charge with 120hz, adaptive brightness and qhd+ 

[s23u battery life ss, 3rd day ](https://imgur."
"the battery life is not an improvement, it's an upgrade."
my point was all day battery life tests are akin to the underwater tests.
com/r/samsung/comments/138ybjw/instead_of_camera_samsung_should_bring_battery/jj1xf1t?
battery time 9+ hours of screen on time / lasts 2 days.
battery is excellent on my unit but the secondary cameras leave a lot to be desired.
he will see better battery life once that message goes away.
these day 3 battery tests mean absolutely nothing.
iphone is your best bet at the moment :) android is literally worse in almost every case and an iphone will last you years if you replace the battery after 2-3 years.
"i am not optimistic with the s23u for the battery life, but i will wait for more testing."
"i have the s23u used it for 3 days and i get constant 4-5 h battery on full charge, with adaptive brightness, variable 120hz and qhd+

this is really bad for a brand new phone but battery still needs to adapt to my usage

[s23u battery life ss at 3rd day of use ](https://imgur."
could be 5g killing your battery.
"no, some ppl just have the s21 and cry that their iphone 11 had way better battery life."
there is battery tests showing the s23+ lasts even longer than the s23u.
"all things the same you should get 15% more battery than the s22u running the same usage pattern, and near the 14 pro max."
"it lasted me all day yesterday with the battery settings on only charge to 85%, so around 6a."
you check the battery status on literally any pair of buds or headphones though.
what it shows is a new phone with an adaptive battery feature that hasn't learned usage patterns yet
"if you want to get excited move to a foldable but for me the fold are too far behind in things like durability, camera quality and battery life."
the only excitement i have about it is better battery life from a much more efficient soc and better pics.
pretty much the only significant advantage iphones have over everything else is battery life.
the only thing the iphone beats the pixel in is battery life.
not too familiar with one plus but never thought they were known for battery life in sot or standby.
they upgraded the processor which resulted in better battery life.
they did not upgrade the battery.
but it's the same (basically) 5000mah battery the ultra series has used for a minute now.
they didn't upgrade the battery.
"not trying to be a smart ass or ""technically"" correct -- just saying i'd like to see an actual battery upgrade to 6000mah like many asian phones have including samsung phones in india, regardless of what processor upgrades we get that might affect battery."
bigger battery would be a battery upgrade.
or changes to the battery chemistry would be a battery upgrade.
"a better processor gets you improved battery life -- but it's not a ""battery upgrade"""
so the battery life is hit or miss with the s22 series and some other series as well.
i had to charge my oneplus 7 pro phone with a battery pack and i'm sick of bringing it with me.
there's been times where i'm fine home from work with a dead phone when i didn't bring a battery bank.
"since 8 gen 2 is manufactured by tsmc unlike the 8 gen 1 and most exynos that manufactured by samsung semiconductor, the battery life should be better on the s23 than it's predecessor."
are people just out in a desert trying to stream netflix and need that much battery?
yeah if they were optimized like iphones then the 13% larger battery would top the 14 pro max.
my phones worked with battery whole life like new.
literally the only reason i was considering it was for better battery life.
why not battery life for instance?
"i love my flip, but i just wish it had a better battery, camera, and they could add some of the s health features."
wow the s23 ultra is about the same battery as the iphone 14 pro max that's insane upgrade from the s22 ultra glad i upgraded
interoperability in samsung ecosystem comes with the cost of heavy bloatware app like smartthings that eat the battery like crazy.
"after few generations of samsung with exynos where heat were an issue, where i had to turn off functionality to have battery, where os updates were gone after the 1st year i decided i had enough."
"so the time your device spends in pocket in some bad signal areas, or doing something in background drains battery, so actual sot for people varies."
"with the case of the base s22, nothing, it would drain its battery by itself in a few hours."
bluetooth i need on due to smart watch but i never use nfc much except odd time if i forget my bank card and only bring my credit card and then have to spend ages turning it on to use google pay and then disable it again (as i find saves battery with it off as i only need it maybe 1 to 2 times a month)
anyone that was surprised by the s22u garbage battery life hadn't been doing their homework.
none of that was remotely correct except better battery and performance.
the pixel 7 pro got the biggest battery in that group but was the 1st one out.
it lost to the s22 which is notoriously bad with battery life lol
i have yet to to see the battery life shown for the s22 ultra.
share here screenshots of battery usage and sot
i mean s23u had like 25% more screen resolution yet only 15% more battery and still matched the iphone 14 pro max in battery life
possibly worth checking the apps in your battery usage (settings -> battery and device care -> battery -> view details) to see if there's any apps that might be the culprit.
"i was noticing the battery life getting worse, to the point where it died on me unexpectedly during a concert."
")

well, after it died during the concert and then the battery not even lasting 8 hours at work doing nothing but sitting in my pocket, another update came along and nearly bricked the phone."
the camera was inoperative and the battery wouldn't even last an hour!
they overheat and run out of battery relatively fast due to the inefficient processor (snapdragon 8 gen 1).
also iphones heavily stops background tasks like netflix/spotify downloading which probably helps the battery life a lot.
"samsung phones have a ton of bloat, and a lot of it runs in the background causing the infamous ""battery life issues"" on exynos, and whilst debloating isn't the full solution (as exynos itself isn't very power optimised as it is) it really does help to debloat."
they just need to increase charging speed & battery sizes.
maybe not but you can't assume your battery life on day one will be your battery life in a month because it will absolutely last you longer a month from now
"it's a bit shocking to me, i've always charged using the samsung 25w, i do overnight charge but for most of the time i've used protect battery which limits charging to 85%"
i find it ridiculous that you have to jump through all of these hoops just to get serviceable battery life
"i have a s10e, barely used daily, and battery runs down to 20%- by end of day, and takes forever like 4-5 hours to charge to 100%"
and probably the pixel pro has a battery health of 90 percent
"if that's the case, lay off the marketing and expenditure on camera shit and focus on the general smartphone experience like battery life and usability."
how many samples do you have in accubattery?
"my s22u only get somewhat decent battery life since the android 13 update, but still not to my liking."
"but before that it was a battery hog, especially when i was in vietnam for a month last year and the phone get super hot."
i already pre-order a s23u because i am going back to vietnam soon and i need a phone with better efficiency and battery life.
they just made big improvement on the battery and reused the zoom lenses and sensors from the s22u.
"on android i've seen it work pretty much everywhere except for certain games

but at least when i got out at 7:00 and return back home at 21:30 i have 50% battery left and that's while using the phone *a lot* during commute (which is over 3 hours)

i'd probably come back to android if there was a phone that could actually last an entire day."
"if the battery issue persists,you should send it in for a battery replacement for a faulty battery(especially if its old) or a repair if there's been some sort of damage to one of the ports of the motherboard(also likely)."
ofc the battery drains also when the screen isn't on but there is now way the difference is this big in one day of usage right?
"nah he's saying the iphone battery is way smaller than the s23u and it still lasts longer, so iphone use power more efficiently"
apps like tiktok are hell on battery life.
my battery is okay but the screen has developed a dark rectangle type  spot in the center going up to the top.
"as far as performance, battery, camera and all that."
"all androids suck with updates and battery life, android auto is trash wont even let you open the google maps on the phone to search something and buggy as hell works about 50% of the time, also none of the android samsung or not have the support for seamless workflow  device to device transition eco system experience as good as apple."
"at least my personal experience iphone has the best face unlock, best performance, longest software support, holds value, better battery life, all the apps run a lot better on ios, whatever works, works flawlessly why would you buy the wanna be iphone samsung phone?"
difference between battery life on n20u/fold 3 compared to s23u is massive actually.
note that this s22 ultra is a snapdragon 8g1 version which has about 10% less battery time than the exynos 2200 version.
doesn't the 14pm have better battery life than the 14p?
"that being said, it looks like your battery health is really poor, and a battery replacement would possibly fix all your issues."
new processor will be far better for battery.
of course daily battery life will be the last test but we will have to wait at least a month for those reviews
"no new usage pattern, no new apps either, just crappier battery life."
there is another one floating around showing a bit less battery life.
especially when there are several people on twitter saying their battery life is similar to their iphone 14 pro max.
samsung did not upgrade the battery.
a few samsung phones in india have a 6000mah battery instead of the s23u 5000mah battery.
now that's a battery upgrade.
i'd pay $400 more for a thicker model that included a 7000mah battery or larger.
i keep reading posts and articles about battery issues with samsung flagship devices but my almost 3 yr old note 20 ultra (snapdragon) averages 8-10+ hrs of sot still with moderate use.
"yeah if the iphone was at 5000mah battery like the s23u, could be insane battery life."
"they act like increasing the battery life is like making a sandwich, but its not that easy of course."
