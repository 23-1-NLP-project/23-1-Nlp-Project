the battery is especially impressive.
battery life is amazing and performance are good ( coming from an op9pro )
it has a bigger battery than the 14p but the 14p smaller screen really makes the difference.
it's not samsung that's the issue my phone is the s20 ultra it's 2 years old and with 120hz i have amazing battery life with even other apps in the background samsung didn't make a shit phone you had to have done something or downloaded something get it looked at by a professional to see what the issue could be and scan it for viruses
i love the battery on my s23 and i came from a s20 fe which had excellent battery after the second year
well apple is industry leader as far as battery life goes due to their super efficient chips.
i've had a 7 pro since release with 0 bugs and the battery bas been amazing.
the battery on my iphones have been markedly better than anything i ever had with android
"regarding the battery life, reliability, etc."
"which leads me to if you are doing that, you're smart enough to have a battery bank with you."
"if he's coming from any other iphone, the battery on the s22u won't be disappointing to him at all."
it's better than both of those series and many other iphones before then in battery life.
"there is several tests out already, the max 14 pro does indeed look like it's still the best flagship overall for battery life."
"the fold 4 chip was such a huge step forward in speed, cooling, efficiency, battery life."
battery technology should always continue to improve.
it doesn’t disrupt any battery life tho
i don't know but i can tell you that the adaptive battery feature works and there are millions of people who can attest to that
battery i'd fine dude
"second it has a larger battery (4500 instead of 4000 on the regular s21) and the screen is a tat bigger (6,4 inch instead of 6."
the thing apple has that is better is the battery life is crazy good.
"s23 ultra has fantastic battery life, it's their camera processing and algorithms they need to spend time on not the hardware"
"when it comes to the basics such as cpu/gpu speed, battery life, system updates, camera/video, etc."
the battery life absolutely does improve over time compared to day one.
i miss android too but with this crazy battery life i can’t complain.
"great screen, great camera, awesome battery life."
"1 to ufs 4
- significantly better battery life
- improved haptics
- improved microphone
- improved speaker sound quality
- stronger glass with gorilla glass victus 2
- possible addition of satellite connectivity later this year
- display color quality improvements with vision booster

and probably more."
"i used samsung phones since s2 untill 3 months ago when i bought the s22 ultra, it was so bad for such an expensive phone with massive lags and stutters and heat and bad battery life, sold it and got the 13 pro max and i am extremely happy and satisfied with it."
"everything is so smooth and snappy and the performance is amazing, battery life is crazy."
love the battery life on my new phone.
"with that i got a bigger brighter screen, 120hz refresh, better battery life, great performance, pretty much the same camera system that they are still using today, and it still has expandable storage."
"it's battery life is pretty decent, the only one issue is sometimes that damn snapdragon chip runs really warm"
not new battery tech but more efficent components.
samsung s23 and a54 use the same battery but the s23 lasts longer while being much faster and having a higher quality screen.
i know it's because its tsmc made processor that the battery improved.
i call that a battery upgrade and i think thats fair
iphone has been and remains the battery king.
my iphone 13 pro max runs buttery smooth and my battery is literally better than any other android phone.
bigger battery.
my s23 ultra has great battery life.
"the s23u has one of the best mainstream flagship battery life now, only beaten by a few gaming phones with 6000mah batteries."
"idk about huge upgrade, but in terms of battery life yes."
hopefully this translates into real world battery life.
"to be fair, this time around the samsung has 23% more pixels and only 15% more battery, so they're incredibly close in overall efficiency."
it's a processor upgrade with benefits to the battery.
just like samsung upgraded its processor to improve battery utilization.
"anyway, besides battery life, these aren't things to complain about."
"the cameras are pretty great, the microphone quality is surprisingly good, the battery life doesn't break records or anything but it can last a while (at least for me), i love goodlock (samsung exclusive customization app), and the power behind it to run emulators is also a huge plus to me, as an avid retro game nut."
"actually the 5,000 mah battery is already good enough especially with the efficiency of snapdragon 8 gen 2 chipset."
probably the most smooth experience you can have with a phone and best battery life i’ve had.
battery life is never that bad.
apple has a small battery size but still provides impressive battery backup.
no need for a battery upgrade when you can do a custom chipset that's more efficient.
"i say the things i care about are battery life, smoothness, speed, customization, bright good display, good connection in weak areas, and camera point and shoot are all good."
personally i've been enjoying the battery life.
pixel 7 actually has pretty decent battery life.
the s23u just happens to have fantastic battery apparently
"the camera actually sucks this year, and the battery is great."
"basic phone features is decent battery, decent screen, can call people, won’t break in a month, can use internet."
so happy for this battery test then
"we don't need bigger batteries, just more efficient components and potentially newer battery technology."
they improved battery life by upgrading the processor.
