few camera features not found in other devices.
camera take forever to open.
performance and camera wise you will love it.
"clearly by their presentation, they are continuing their focus on cameras and now video."
"""oh the camera improved a little bit and in this specific situation you can see the difference"", ""the phone does not lag"" yeah no shit sherlock its a fucking new phone, ""the resolution is the same as the one in the previous phone"" yeah no shit we dont need more resolution anyway for that overpriced piece of glass with some silicon inside."
cameras do a lot more than hdr processing.
"some cameras lean warm/cool, some over/under expose, etc."
"its actually pretty easy

you have dedicated os to one dedicated lineup of phones

there is thousands of phones with android, its harder to tweak the camera software"
but something that seems to be synonymous with mobile phones are its cameras that many people do use each and every day.
a 500euro camera with 600 euro lens is better than a smartphone.
fold 4 is easily on par with s22u cameras apart from lacking 10x optical zoom.
i love the mega zoom on the camera of the s22 ultra.
this is refreshing to see plus the smaller hole punch for front camera.
i have the s22 ultra and it is an amazing phone with a great camera and display i love it.
that and the fact with pixel the camera/app is their main selling point.
"s23 ultra has fantastic battery life, it's their camera processing and algorithms they need to spend time on not the hardware"
"when it comes to the basics such as cpu/gpu speed, battery life, system updates, camera/video, etc."
"seriously, i don't know what you have against the utility of phone cameras and them creeping closer to being a viable alternative to professional gear in some situations but in good sunlight i can crop in massively and see a hell of a lot of detail."
"great screen, great camera, awesome battery life."
"the differences are:
- improved primary camera sensor/improved camera software algorithms for improved clarity/autofocus improvements/can now do 8k30fps video
- significantly more powerful cpu/gpu
- improved cooling system
- faster ram
- faster storage with move from ufs 3."
"with that i got a bigger brighter screen, 120hz refresh, better battery life, great performance, pretty much the same camera system that they are still using today, and it still has expandable storage."
"korea (and china to some extent) for things related to ""in-depth"" explanations and software developments (one ui, software updates, camera improvememts) since a lot of users from those regions use that members app to read about technical stuff samsung is doing or something along those lines."
"and i agree samsung phones have come a long way to compete, and even best apple devices for best picture camera."
"> 
> to overcome this, the galaxy camera applies a deep learning-based ai detail enhancement engine (detail enhancement technology) at the final stage to effectively remove noise and maximize the details of the moon to complete a bright and clear picture of the moon."
other than that the camera is good on the iphone
me personally in my mindset i’d wait one more year because i see next year being the year samsung makes big design changes along with a new telephoto camera and all the other stuff but enjoy the phone bro it’s gonna be a really awesome upgrade
they put an 8k camera with the best smartphone camera out there ***and removed the sd card slot*** that for years has made it very affordable to have 1-2tb of space on a phone.
"look at the difference in camera quality in the s22u between the snapdragon and exynos version, the exynos version had a different isp and had a different quality."
"and at the end of the day, a digital camera is just there to give you what *it thinks* it saw, with its sensors."
"1 update descriptions so i was curious to see if they finally nailed it, i'd never thought i'd see this day but oh boy it is definitely super smooth now, gestures animation is lot more sync to the touch and smooth, especially openning and closing camera app transitions is instant now without the delay that we had previously when re-openning the camera app again after closing."
"my s23 non ultra can take a pretty good photo of the moon with the 3x camera, but the 10x looks really good."
iphone has an edge on speed because they opted for a much more basic camera setup.
"incremental processor improvements, better camera hardware, and that is it."
"i originaly loved ltt because they had the most in depth phone reviews, they would talk about circumstances that no one else even considered and they were very well executed, and not their phone reviews on short circuit are just ""it turns on, it has a good build, let me read the specs sheet for a bit, the camera is good, the speakers are good."
"the cameras are pretty great, the microphone quality is surprisingly good, the battery life doesn't break records or anything but it can last a while (at least for me), i love goodlock (samsung exclusive customization app), and the power behind it to run emulators is also a huge plus to me, as an avid retro game nut."
countless memes of android's camera.
i just prefer the overall vibe of the note 10 plus or 20 ultra but i like the camera of the 10 the best.
my iphone family has taken notice of the samsung cameras.
the s23 needs a camera update or 2 and then it will be good to go
getting the camera to focus on the main thing.
"i say the things i care about are battery life, smoothness, speed, customization, bright good display, good connection in weak areas, and camera point and shoot are all good."
then iphone camera's got better and beat the competition up until the s21 and s22 series where samsung took over again.
show me an actual camera that uses ai to add details that it didn't capture.
it was advertised as a very smart phone with an amazing camera
"the camera actually sucks this year, and the battery is great."
"it gets hot but it is smooth camera is lit 
mine is sd i play ps2  emulator and it gives 5-6  sot  its a good experience after s8"
"yes it's just smartphone, that's why it's called smart and not just phone, it has many features including camera"
"over the past several years, he's accumulated a handful of decent cameras up to now (a couple of 6k brands idr, panasonic gh5 ii, a couple of blackmagics idr, sony fx3, red komodo)."
"if you double click the power button, you get to camera app instantaneously."
"i love my ipad for gaming, my bad eyes, but give me samsung everytime i need an amazing camera!"
