i couldn't even record 4k for a few min without the camera app crashing.
people have drawn smiley faces on the moon and taken photos with samsung cameras.
"mkbhd retweeted a link to the thread, an ios camera app went semi viral for linking the reddit post on twitter, and now seemingly everyone in the tech community is convinced samsung moon photos are just ."
"5mm, just make the phone another couple millimeters thicker and stop cramming so much useless camera shit into the corner."
"this comment is basically  ""i have no idea what i am talking about""

define fake, do you know what happens after you press the shutter on your phones camera when you take that nice picture of beach ?"
"don't worry, the s22 series already were down hard globally, there is no reason s23 costs the same, its the same phone with yearly new chip and updated camera sensor yet charging 1200$ lmao and in the case of the ultra only main cam were updated, the zooms lenses/sensors are 3 years old and identical."
"i wish the camera, battery/charging specs would improve dramatically."
if you want a quick point and shoot camera that can easily take photos of moving objects such as kids and animals then samsung is not for you.
camera is not as good as samsung though -- (switched from a samsung note 9)
"disagree, cameras are already really good, but are not a day to day thing for the vast majority of people, battery however impacts every single person using the phones."
don't get the a53 with an exynos chip and no telephoto camera.
"instead get the a52s, cheaper, better camera with a snapdragon 778g"
"and here i am contemplating on buying the 23 ultra having a 14 pro…

i also have the fold 4 but those cameras are so bad compared to iphone or the ultra"
galaxy ultra models have a 108mp camera sensor as well as 30x optical zoom and 100x digital zoom.
the pixel 4xl had a better camera and no software bloat.
"if you shoot in jpeg, the camera's ai has to decide which of the data to include in the jpeg and which to discard."
different cameras' ais process photos differently.
"and when using digital zoom, many cameras now have ais that reconstitute the photo to full resolution instead of just cropping it, by extrapolating from the data and making up stuff to fill in the blanks."
"and back to the ipad camera, small not to high quality, and use as much space as possible on battery alone."
"you realize stock camera app is tied to software optimalization, not just hardware

thats why a lot of android phone users tend to download gcam instead of their native camera app because google tend to do coding better"
"as it stands with the s23u, i'd take better cameras than better battery tech (or soc efficiency), if i had to pick one."
"for the s22u, i'd pick a better soc than camera, if i had to pick one."
i tried on picture with 30x zoom and moved camera a bit.
i'm not counting on the 200mp camera making a difference - could actually be worse.
"lmao, we are talking about the stock camera app, not 3rd party app optimizations."
this is about their camera 2 and camera x apis.
it has nothing to do with comparing samsung cameras to google's cameras.
how does the 13 pro camera compare in your pov?
"i think he is refering to shutter lag on the camera, which samsung has had problems with ever since the s20."
still doesn't mean it's a relevant response - especially as samsung just told someone their phone isn't a professional movie camera.
"i therefore returned the s22 ultra after 2 weeks but few weeks ago my oneplus front camera stopped working so i ordered the s23 ultra

i now had the s23 ultra for 3 days, and speaker really got improved, sounding a bit better that the oneplus,  screen is the same so still red tones too muddy in my opinion and not enough screen colours customisation, for video the noise issue got solved, noise is nowhere near as bad in video and camera switching in social media apps is not as laggy as on s22 ultra, i still prefer the colours of videos on the op7 pro, which look more pleasing to the eyes and the fact that photos are more natural looking on op7 pro with less oversharpening and better colours."
"also if you use bereal, there is some issues with the front camera where there is nothing but noise in dark conditions, like the output looks like a 100$ phone at night on bereal (when taking selfies with other social media or camera app that issue is not there so hoping for a fix)

however it's been 3 days now and battery life is not really good, better than on oneplus obviously but i charge it 2 times a day, where i charged my oneplus 4 times a day."
"no phone camera images are ""100% real"""
"in the case of the 7 pro, i think a pro to its battery is that the camera doesn’t drain the phone as bad as samsung, apple, and other camera apps on phones do."
i’ve used my 7 pro with its camera open for 2+ hours and can come home with 50-60% left.
it wasn’t tested here because the phone died before the camera test started.
"you can see your phones screen directly on the tablet and move it around like a window, you can even take a video call from your phone, on your tablet and use the camera on your tablet like if you were directly on the phone."
they really have no incentive to fiddle with it particularly given it is generally owners of other oem devices that want the google camera app on their phone anyway lol.
"yeah i agree the swap won't be as noticeable but i personally think you underestimate the difference for example the s23 ultra comes with a new 200mp camera, has a much brighter screen, much more powerful chip(especially if you're in europe) and much better battery life, i'm going from the s21 ultra to the s23 ultra mostly for battery life and chip performance especially as i'm in uk and have a shitty exynos chip plus i've never had a note so i'm excited to have an s pen and boxed shaped phone"
most people aren't concerned with the minute differences in the camera either.
"video cameras can take stills, still cameras can take video, phones can do both."
the simplistic logic of well it's not a video camera isn't really applicable anymore as this isn't the 80's where a video camera was a video camera and a phone plugged into your wall and was a phone.
"waste of resources, 200mp is marketing bs otherwise big studios would have cameras like that but they don't"
"try downloading samsung's (good lock)plug-in for samsung camera, [camera assistant](https://apps."
cameraassistant) it may improve your experience.
"yes, there were no true android alternatives to samsung phones up until s6 in terms of performance, camera etc,then samsung switched to one ui wich i love."
i rather they rip out the cameras and put another 3000mah in there.
or leave an s10-like camera unit at the very least
"i see them promote pixels over samsungs all the time and over pixel as the iphone replacement

the pixel sucks period and is worse in everything but the camera apparently or if you got brainwashed into thinking you want a more ""pure"" android os lmao"
price about the same (here on my country) and s21 seems better on cameras and overall
"instead the should do a phone with a low quality camera, bo front camera and insain screen and battery life instead."
"it doesn't have major wear, those are just bad poctures i took with my sports camera but the phkme is at best 9/10, minor scuffs on screen a d minor scuffs on the bezel, no cracks no dents."
the reviewers only care about the camera performance over everything else.
"you mean aside from:
- improved primary camera sensor/improved camera software algorithms for improved clarity/autofocus improvements/can now do 8k30fps video
- significantly more powerful cpu/gpu
- improved cooling system
- faster ram
- faster storage with move from ufs 3."
if these cameras did that people in the southern hemisphere would immediately notice samsung was fucking with their photos.
"they need to get better with the f5, ultra like camera, better crease, better resolution displays."
you can also try clearing data/cache of the camera app.
"same design, same cameras minus one being 108 and the other being 200 megapixels that you can barely see the difference in, same s-pen, etc."
i almost bought it because of that but it didn't offer the camera and some other samsung features i wanted.
"there are so many dedicated gamer phones around with no emphasis on the camera, the user interface, on support with update over the years."
pretty sure battery tech has always been slower than camera improvements.
anyway i left phone in a repair shop for cleaning hope it works otherwise i guess i would need to buy the camera module
"200 mp camera isn't innovation, because the least amount of people will both know what this actually means, how to leverage it and also appreciate it."
">in the case of this camera, it is using ai to add additional details based on other data not contained in the picture."
"then what does it matter if i can also afford and buy a ""real"" camera or not?"
you can use your cameras led on the back for notifications.
rn i am on a trip and the camera is just so laggy by the time i am trying to take a pic of something it is already passed.
in fact i realized the moon shots were fishy a long time ago which is one reason among many that made me realize it wasn't worth owning a so called ultra phone on the basis of the camera.
"i'm also looking into switching from iphone to a samsung, i use a windows pc so i don't care about the ecosystem, the only thing i care about is camera quality."
it was advertised as camera when r.
yeah but they’re still faking it to make their camera seem better than the iphones via commercials.
"hot take: perhaps if nothing phone would've allocated more resources to their camera department instead of opting for those goofy ass backpanel leds, then maybe we'd have a looker."
i have it set to turn on dnd while the camera is open so it gets rid of the annoying shutter sound.
"my camera is always blurry, and i have the ultra."
"as far as waiting on the fold 5, if it comes with better cameras it would be worth the wait ( low light is my only complaint on fold 4 cameras)."
"but if you're evidence are the picture of your phone with foggy camera and a screenshot from their website, then i don't think it would be a good battle."
"android is splintered into hundreds of different phones all with different skins, hardware even socs so it's more difficult to optimise camera and video for each of those different phones."
com/r/samsung/comments/138ybjw/instead_of_camera_samsung_should_bring_battery/jj1xf1t?
foldables have bad cameras.
samsung needs to upgrade the telephoto and uw camera sensors to flagship levels too like many chinese oem's.
battery is excellent on my unit but the secondary cameras leave a lot to be desired.
if i've got my tripod and 5 minutes to frame the shot and set up the camera.
"it’s a smart phone, but it’s not smart enough to be a video camera."
the samsung camera has been equally bad with every model i've tried.
"this is why i've stuck with the a53, because the difference between the photos this junk camera takes and the one samsung is charging an extra $1,200 for look pretty much identical after their processing does what it does."
"realistically, who the hell uses 8k anyways, its pointless, if someone has enough to buy a 8k tv with hardware powerful enough to run 8k content then they have enough to buy a proper 8k camera to record their content in which their viewers  will watch in their 1080p iphones anyways."
"the camera ,120hz screen and build quality are better tho."
"the camera is still better than your dslr this post is explaining that when you take a moon shot it's gonna be very ""fixed"" for you i don't believe this is the case for every photo"
clearly you are saying that the ultra line focuses on cameras and video to distinguish itslef from the rest.
although the camera can't stay open for longer than 8m on recording which sucks and the phone isn't even hot
let's stop lying to ourselves and accept the truth that apple is in a league of its own in video recording and camera experience (non existing shutter lag and speed to open the camera).
"not at all defending samsung's ridiculous response to this, it is their own fault for marketing the video capabilities of something that is "" not a video camera"", however absolutely no one needs 10bit 8k video from a cellphone."
"if you want to get excited move to a foldable but for me the fold are too far behind in things like durability, camera quality and battery life."
"like, i know that iphones might have better performance, software, cameras and if i had other apple devices, a more seamless ecosystem."
pixels might be running a lighter version of android and have better cameras in some situations and might have less stuff installed but guess what?
"in the case of this camera, it is using ai to add additional details based on other data *not contained in the picture*."
my friend received his s22 and the camera doesn't work lol.
straight up doesn't boot into the camera when launching the app.
"big reviewers only cares about ""specs"" on paper, and camera performance."
"they have less innovation compared to years ago however - they still have one of the best cameras, they have the beat display each year, their soc (not exynos) is always the best android can offer, offer shit ton of features that other softwares don't ( of course some companies have things that samsung doesn't but are not as feature rich overall) and the experiance is almost appleesque."
after like 3 months i asked if i can just have it back to fix it myself (camera array cracked) and they admitted they didn't have it this whole time.
"got like a $10 camera on aliexpress and found a guide to fix it, took like 10 minutes."
"i love my flip, but i just wish it had a better battery, camera, and they could add some of the s health features."
"""please note that it's a smartphone and not a video camera"" 
but clearly professionals expected to be able to use it as such, based on the marketing."
although both are far from proper camera.
it is a smartphone and not a video camera.
"sure, 4k or a camera with a bigger sensor would do wonders (and sometimes we shoot videos with my 4k cameras but they come with their own compromises), but i concern myself more with the quality of my content."
the camera was inoperative and the battery wouldn't even last an hour!
what is really missed is how great the night sight is for the camera.
edit: it happens most noticeably when panning/moving the camera around.
"however the reviews are just too bland with antutu, camera this vs this, so much ram etc"
my s21 plus camera just stopped working  and i.
better camera's is cap.
it went like this- early phones (up until the s8) had better camera's then the iphones of that year.
everyone talks about android fragmentation and these camera apis are a method of unifying support for third party apps.
"i haven't noticed any issues, i've also used an external camera app with 8k without any issues either."
"the most i've seen cameras do is hdr processing, and that's actually using addition information captured from the scene, not inventing it on the fly."
"if that's the case, lay off the marketing and expenditure on camera shit and focus on the general smartphone experience like battery life and usability."
"i don't care about the camera but went with it, since i thought that's the state of flagships."
everyone always said android is cheap and has poor camera quality.
"samsung and apple have better camera output, more support, and more longevity across the board."
"samsung phones, like any other phones don't merely take a single photo and process it, it takes like 10 photos, starting even before you moved the camera, and then it mashes them together, trying to take the sharpest parts of all the pictures, and then does some ai magic on top of that."
plus the camera was crap because the chip can’t keep up.
"as far as performance, battery, camera and all that."
if i wanted to take a picture of the moon using a phone instead of the $5k camera i have for whatever reason i would again pull my s22 ultra out of the drawer.
"show me a single camera, phone camera or real one, that does not use ai to process your photos, lmao."
"its simply just a ""very fast phone with maybe the best camera?"
"8"" display, went from 60hz to 120hz, went from a rear fingerprint to under screen, went from a forehead and chin to near bezel-less and a pin hole for selfie camera, gained 5g antenna, went from dual 12mp camera system to dual 12mp and a 108mp zoom lens, plus all of the usual upgrades."
"very similar design, similar screen to body ratio, similar pinhole camera cutout, same refresh/resolution, similar camera system, etc."
"double storage base model

better selfie and main camera

flatter edges make screen less curved, better for spen

excited to try the astro photo stuff."
it takes approximately two blinks of an eye to go from another app to being in the camera app ready to take a picture.
"i remember watching it and him referring to his ""professional sony camera."
the only pixel i would recommend is the a series for people who are on a serious budget but still wan't a decent phone with a top tier camera.
but i can’t wait to use the camera on my next local rocket launch opportunity!
"i went outside tonight to test the camera tonight, as starlink was flying over, but no matter how good the camera is, it’s not busting through cloud coverage."
"even stuff that would be a genuine improvement for the day to day use, which we btw, know samsung and others are totally capable of, most notably no crease and cameras on par with the s series, aren't done because."
