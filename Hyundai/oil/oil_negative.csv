"they also don't recall: engines that fail at very low miles, burning 2 quarts of oil brand new, spontaneously combustion cars, cars that go on fire when not even running, early mileage transmission failures, crankshafts out of  tolerance, steering wheels coming off while driving, ect."
"within the first year it began to use a lot of oil, and within the two years of ownership i quit changing the oil, and just swapped filters because it never kept the 4 quarts for the oil change interval."
"the oil change interval was 6k miles, but i even switched from 5w20 to 5w30 and 3k."
excessive oil consumption.
i've got a sonata that's under ten years old that go's through 3l of oil between oil changes at 5000km.
i've got a lot older vehicles with original engines that i don't have to even check the oil between changes.
maybe they should own their oil consumption problems.
"i should add that this dealer and another dealer i talked to in the area are both saying that they havent gotten a single approval from hyundai corporate on anything relating to oil consumption issues and this induction cleaning every 30k is what everyone is supposed to be doing to fix the problem, but that just sounds like a soggy bandaid on a defective organ, and doesnt stop the carbon build up from ruining your catalytic converters either."
excessive oil consumption for these cars was ridiculous.
putting in 5 quarts of oil every 5 weeks is insane.
"with the corolla, we had oil leaks, exhaust system replacements, a bunch of other stuff i’ve forgotten about, and traded it in (presumably for sale to a scrap dealer) when the thing mercifully gave up and died after 6 years of ownership."
"many of the same problems as the corolla with oil leaks, exhaust system issues, etc."
"also, their customer service refused to honor the warranty (oil consumption issues on sonata 2017)."
"as you brought your car in for general maintenance (oil), they would have checked your tires every time."
my dealer did the oil and rotate every time.
"this thing will drink oil like it's no other, at about 2000 miles after an oil change, i need to buy a 5 qt and start refilling as the oils are just bone dry."
"now i do live in an extremely hot area in the summer, and i understand all turbo engines uses the oil to cool it down, so there are naturally more oil consumption needed."
they asked me why i havent used any oil changes.
"however, the engine issues (with the theta ii and oil consumption on other models) and some transmission issues (though much smaller in occurrence than engines), combined with how the repair is handled (time to get parts, time to repair, whether there’s a loaner in situations that take time and result in loss-of-use), if poor, all reflect on hyundai to the average buyer."
they changed the weight of the oil.
i had a bad ignition coil and a warped head gasket that hyundai failed to mention/observe after multiple appointments.
"tiresplus replaced my sparkplugs (autozone told me to put in the wrong ones), the gasket, and the ignition coil for $900 and my car is running better than ever."
"my twenty year old accent made it 550,000 with only oil changes and new tires and others atleast to 350,000 miles."
i believe with usa suit hyundai was court ordered to deal with the engines which judging by the posts means that they'll piss ass around with oil consumption texts and the like to get some cash off you buy once the engine goes boom they'll deal with it.
"which involves doing all the oil consumption texts, scoping the engines, and anything else the dealers can do to make a few bucks and then turning people done if they can find any reason to do so but helping the cases they'd have the biggest problems denying and them saying "" look at us, aren't we wonderful""."
"toyota engines are terrible, they have been burning oil for decades, especially the 4 cylinders."
"other than regular maintenance, oil change, change of tires, the only issue was an unforeseen battery swap."
"exactly, most people who had issues are the people who changed their conventional oil every 10,000 miles."
the engine oil problem is famous with a lot of hyundai vehicles.
yeah i actually went to mr tire 1x to get a tire rotation & oil change.
"you should be checking your oil every 2-3 fuel fill-ups, just like the ""good old days"" when the service station would check your oil at every fill-up."
i've never had a brand new vehicle get piston slap or need ignition coils within a couple years of owning it.
one huge example is the oil change.
"for an engine to last you need

changle oil every year or 7500-8500km on gasoline engines alongside the filter
change the oil after the first 1000km to get rid of possible filings."
fucking website says oil changes every 2y/15k km.
"and to add on the above, there is no engine above 1800cc/4cyl that wont burn oil, turbo or not."
4l engine without changing or even filling oil.
"i have a 2017 elantra and a 2022 elantra hybrid, the 2017 just had its first problem which was a cheap and easy fix (ignition coil)."
we replace engines all the time for oil consumption.
2015 elantra gt (blown engine @80k) and 2017 sonata se with fouling spark plugs and charging them daily bad oil consumption (@78k)
"i've changed my oil every 4,000 miles or so, which is very close to severe factory conditions."
nothing burns oil like a toyota.
i think i just need to jump through their hoops and do the oil consumption tests.
"it just seems to me that 3 months ago, they did the work, i spent $600, and now there's still an oil issue."
"my car is turbo using 5w-30 , basic trim mode using 5w-20 oil

twice they put 5w-20 oil change sticker on the windshield,  even though they said they do put 5w-30 in the car, there is no way to tell."
and the recent one  they double filled the  engine oil.
not everyone changes the oil when they do those gaskets for some reason.
"my opinion has always been if you open the engine up like that you should change the oil, especially in a leak situation so you know that it’s 100% full and ready to go."
"org/blog/new-hyundai-kia-engine-failure-settlement-covers-2m-additional-vehicles)

or how about the excessive oil consumption lawsuit?"

"i did not have the theta engine, but my 2016 hyundai tucson ended up having the oil consumption issue and kicked the can last week."
"i also have a full carfax that shows my vehicle was maintenances prior to me owning it, as in oil changes, inspections etc."
"i’ve only owned the vehicle since july 31st, and was not due for my first oil change yet but had one scheduled."
recommended oil changes are way more often then 8k.
"that being said, hyundai only pays for the ""7500"" oil changes."
"have  had hyundai’s for over 2 decades…changed oil and tires and one oil pan …that’s it  in about 25yrs

never understood the hatred ."
i own a 2018 sonata hybrid and hyundai mistakenly thought i was the second owner and said i could not qualify for a warranty oil consumption test because i was the second owner.
it took original sales paperwork and a battle with the warranty department to get my dealership to recognize that i was the original owner to qualify for the oil consumption testing.
"and i change my oil every 8000 miles, i havent had issues with the car and own it for 2 years already"
"stick with a winner

if you have 75k miles and it's eating oil, the answer is no."
there’s the oil consumption lawsuit that affects nearly every hyundai engine since 2012.
as i just started having oil burning problems.
"com/hyundai-announces-oil-consumption-recall-what-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=the%20recall%20affects%20several%20models,no%20cost%20to%20the%20owner."
"then it was shaking and was burning oil, so i knew it was time to replace it rather than try to fix it."
"because it has a very bad historical reputation for burning oil and fires even up to just 2021, so there’s still a lot of ground to makeup to establish themselves as dependable."
"curious, how often did you do your oil changes?"
at the end of the day it all boils down to money.
"regular maintenance and oil changes on time with my coupon book when i bought it,  replaced 3 year old maintenance free battery n/c and they even emailed me a detailed video of any other concerns they spot with a quote , i wouldn't go anywhere else !"
"yes so since i’ve only owned the vehicle for 4000 miles, i haven’t had to do any maintenance, i had an oil change scheduled for the end of this month (which is early) for the recommended mileage."
i had a 2012 accent sel and it consumed oil.
i traded that in for a 2018 elantra sel and it's consuming oil.
oil into the coolant because they're incompetent as hell.
then they tried to not warranty the engine without proof of his last five oil changes despite him only having like 40k miles on it.
"about 80,000 miles, it would suck down almost five quarts of oil between oil changes at 3,000 miles."
it’s almost as if there was a portal to narnia in my engine somewhere siphoning off oil a little bit at a time.
"after an oil consumption test, the local dealer decided to run another oil consumption test and determine if the connecting rod bearings were the issue."
"my friend’s coworker asked him about how much oil a car should be going through at oil changes, he asked me and come to find out she has a newer hyundai sonata with a 2."
"""thieves, you will need 3 cases of oil to leave the state."
"pretty self explanatory, what with all the early engine failures, fires, burning oil, steering wheels falling off, class action lawsuits, recalls."
yea i have 73k on my 2018 and have went through 2 sets of spark plugs nad ignition coils.
put your tin foil hats on for this one.
plus the oil consumption issues are even on 2022s and that was a lawsuit in 2022 so how do we know the newest ones are any different?
it seems oil consumption has been an issue since 2009.
hyundai tried to cover up theta3s oil consumption by putting in a longer dipstick.
"at 20k miles the ignition coils went out, and again at 42k miles, along with paint literally peeling off of my car."
"i just hope its not the oil control rings which is one of the big factors in the oil consumption issue, looser rings help with gas mileage but wear out easier over time."
"ah, you must be referring to my statements that oil changes every 3,000 miles are bullshit?"
"fwiw, as a 2013 azera owner, who’s car had the engine/oil issues at 97k miles…."
"made the the dealership take engine photos and track down every oil change i got, but now i’m driving a 2023 hybrid elantra loaner while they wait 5 months to get a engine replacement…
so, maybe yea, but sell the thing before you hit that 100k mark."
you must’ve missed out on the oil burning hondas and all the most network speakers popping.
"my 2017 hybrid has had the following issues
- wire harness problem when bought (2017)
- hybrid starter belt tensions seized (2023)
- hybrid starter was performing sub optimal (2023)
- i had a loose linkage in my front suspension (2022)
- they have repaired my tires under warranty 2 years after the warranty expired 

all repaired under warranty, with zero issues

our 2022 sante fe had a leak in the turbo oil line, also fixed with out issue 

would i buy again?"
2007-2015 have issues with their steering couplers and excessive oil consumption.
yea was thinking the same but not sure my car is worth much at all and still runs fine and not nearly eating as much oil as before
"i owned a 2019 optima, it would consume so much oil and i had only 55,000 miles on it; previous owner maintained it well and kept receipts, then the transmission developed a hard shift (at cold), so fool me i guess."
he recently traded it towards an ioniq and can’t make an appnt for the hyundai scheduled oil change/tire rotation.
"engines dying, new engines burning excess oil, poor build quality."
engine was losing oil with no leaks/blue smoke.
i would be out of oil within 3 weeks from getting an oil change (4l of oil).
"i own a 2016 sonata se, it’s started to burn oil ~95k mark."
at 27k (4 years ago) i had an ignition coil replaced under warranty.
132k and noticed no oil consumption or general issues.
wasn’t that one of the oil consumption ones
my 2018 sonata (75k) is burning oil like a champ.
"oil consumption issues is happening not to just hyundai , but to other brand of cars because of the push for more mpgs."
car manufactures are loosing the piston rings so there's less friction so they can get out more mpgs with thinner oils like 0w20.
as the ages the rings become more looser and then burns more oil.
the ones that burn oil are
i drive a lot and get oil changes more frequently than they recommend.
i've read stories of dealers refusing oil changes below 8k intervals or minimum times between changes.
"there is also a procedure that’s either an all day or overnight process that allows cleaner to soak in the cylinders in an attempt to clean the piston ring grooves and unstick them, and i have seen this process at least reduce oil consumption to half or more of the consumption rate before in several cases."
"5 came out, it burned oil and caused the same issues as the theta 2 due to the lack of holes i'm the piston to let oil back into the pan."
it did not consume any oil.
"but  any non-warranty work other than oil changes (less expensive, any dealer can do them, and it creates a paper trail in case oil consumption becomes an issue) will be done by my own mechanic, and this is one of many reason."
"old fords used to have the starter solenoid right next to the battery, all you needed to steal the older fords was a couple of jumper wires, one to jump power to the starter solenoid and another to jump power to the ignition coil."
"it burns so much oil, i have to add 4 quarts of oil every 3 weeks!"
i had an oil consumption test at the dealership per their recommendation.
they found out that my car burns a lot of oil lol.
i really can’t afford 10$/day in oil lol
"i have a 2019 elantra @ 70k miles and no issues (yet) with oil consumption but seeing how hyundai treats their customers down on their luck, i don’t feel inclined to give them my business in the future."
"nope not yet lol i had to oil consumption problem, still kind of do not so bad i changed the pct valve clean the solenoids front and back throttle body etc."
", changed spark plugs and coil packs, going to get a carbon clean out too and needs timing/water pump too."
my 17 santa fe burned through 6 quarts of oil in less than 5000 miles.
my last oil change was done at the local hyundai dealer.
it would be negligence to not change/top off the oil and charge for that aswell.
let's hope your engine isn't consuming oil and it's just a mistake
went in for oil change and tire rotation.
get dealership to do an oil consumption test.
you will need to bring it in every x many miles to add oil and measure oil burned.
"i just buy the oil from autozone and fill it up, then at every other fill up i change the filter."
i always wondered why my engine seemed quiet after an oil change.
now i knew why- it was eating oil!
drove 6000mi and no oil consumption.
honda hasn't been doing much better with its oil dilution issue with its 1.
corolla is a tad on the smaller side of the compact segment with a relatively new transmission and impreza has had engine oil burning issues in past generations so that really only leaves mazda 3 who happens to be the only compact that has stuck with a non cvt.
their turbo engines were burning oil.
i had a 2006 hyundai v6 that started burning oil around 110k miles in.
"they also don't recall: engines that fail at very low miles, burning 2 quarts of oil brand new, spontaneously combustion cars, cars that go on fire when not even running, early mileage transmission failures, crankshafts out of  tolerance, steering wheels coming off while driving, ect."
"1st had problems, burning oil and fuel pump, 2nd had recalled engine problems."
"in fact, my hyundai dealership told me that they're \*required\* to rotate the tires with every complimentary oil change, and that hyundai will deny a complimentary oil change if it isn't accompanied by a tire rotation."
if you are burning this much oil.
"also, i assumed they did an oil change when they did the rocker gasket."
took it in for my first routine oil change.
"the rx7 is supposed to burn oil,lol."
"it's just like a hydrophobic coating but hydro repels water and oleo repels water, dust, grease and oils such as finger print oils."
and make sure the surface is as clean and smudge free as you can get it before applying it so you don't lock the oils underneath the coating.
"when written up for the repair order, its actually included on the same line as the oil change."
"bad oil consumption, knocking, and recent fires."
"just went thru explaining to my cousin about the oil dilution on her newish accord, which now needs new motor."
