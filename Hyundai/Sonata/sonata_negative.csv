never liked the body of the sonatas in the recent years.
same thing happened to me with my 2016 sonata.
i've got a sonata that's under ten years old that go's through 3l of oil between oil changes at 5000km.
"bought a 2015 sonata hybrid in 2016, 13k on it when purchased."
"also, their customer service refused to honor the warranty (oil consumption issues on sonata 2017)."
awd sonata n when?
i love my 2018 hyundai sonata but i am still pissed that i can no longer remote start my car unless i subscribe to blue link.
"i did not care one bit about the current sonata, but if this were available when i buying my car, i'm not sure i would've bought my 6."
"i also had a lemon sonata and got rid of it after a year, all hyundai dealerships in my area avoided my car cause none of them could fix the problems, the last one i went to was the one i bought from and i literally put me on the waiting list for months and when the time is due, they pushed it back again twice, to avoid failing to fix my car for my eligibility for lemon law."
"no, i had a 23 sonata hybrid and all the problems i had with that car was the reason why i didnâ€™t go back and get another sonata hybrid after going through lemon law, mind you iâ€™ve had the car from late november to mid march and itâ€™s been in the dealership for majority of that time iâ€™ve only had it in my possession for about a month."
i had a 2018 sonata for awhile with pretty much 0 issues.
"i had a 13 sonata limited, hated the way the new sonatas look , so i went for the elantra limited hybrid."
the next thing that you will say is if someone offered you a choice of vehicles for free either your 2014 sonata or my 2023 mdx you would still take the 2014 sonata over the mdx.
you drive a crappy piece of junk hyundai sonata & youâ€™re making fun of my vehicle ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤®
do sonataâ€™s compete with the honda accord and toyota camry?
"in the sonata, the hud settings, driver seat positions (both 1 & 2), and side mirror positions are all saved to the profiles."
"they always seem to change their design heavily every generation (i know this one is a refresh/lci), does the sonata have a true design identity?"
in reality you drive a pos hyundai sonata.
i own a fucking piece of shit 2015 sonata.
a few months pre-pandemic my 2014 sonata engine seized several hours from home right at about 92k miles.
"i am not getting rid of my current sonata, but may buy a 2024 or 2025."
sonatas are also no good.
like the other guy said itâ€™s all rumours but i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they discontinued it and left the sonata nameplate behind with the ice lineup and continued its legacy with a new name for the evâ€™s.
im a fan but am i gonna get my unlimited engine warranty with all the recalls of my 2012 sonata
2015 elantra gt (blown engine @80k) and 2017 sonata se with fouling spark plugs and charging them daily bad oil consumption (@78k)
"the sonata needs to be an elegant, slightly understated sedan."
iâ€™d probably be angry at the world too if i had to drive a sonata
i purchased a addon kit for my 2019 sonata that just plugs into my stock security system.
the sonata refresh was probably already ready or close from ready for production by that point.
"i got a toltal of 135,900 out of this piece of junk and i was told that a average sonata goes 275,,000 miles!"
i own a 2018 sonata hybrid and hyundai mistakenly thought i was the second owner and said i could not qualify for a warranty oil consumption test because i was the second owner.
"now that being said, 2018 sonataâ€™s are not yet part of the massive engine repair recall."
iâ€™ve had 2 sonatas and then bought a santa fe blue hybrid.
iâ€™ve had a 22 sonata n-line night edition for 16.
"whenever i see the tail lights on a current generation black or portofino gray sonata at dusk, i find myself wanting to buy the car for that alone."
i have a 2018 turbo sport sonata (third engine replacement since it was built) when i got my car back my whole entire fuel pump was out.
i thought they were scrapping the sonata
"its a shame because i like the look of the optimas, k5, elantra, and sonata."
"if people are looking to steal a sonata, they know what a sonata looks like"
i had an a 17 sonata that the engine went.
"i have a 2018 sonata, and in the cold it wouldn't start."
i really dislike the current sonata and elantra.
got my sonata hybrid at msrp minus incentives and getting about 35% better mpg than op.
i have a sonata hybrid with push button start.
0t sonata or optima will have the same engine but built in the us with the potential defect (metal shaving residue left after machining the cylinders).
optima and sonata sold outside of north america with a 2.
i hope there is some appearance difference between the n line  and the regular sonata
com/63c4bd441c21782eb0d195d5/6420d6f59155222455a172c9_thenewsonata(photo8).
have a 2016 sonata now as well as other cars and you really can't beat hyundai for features  and looks.
> there was a report last year that hyundai was going to discontinue the sonata once the current generation has ended.
bought a used 2016 hyundai sonata with a 2.
"my friendâ€™s coworker asked him about how much oil a car should be going through at oil changes, he asked me and come to find out she has a newer hyundai sonata with a 2."
itâ€™s about a sonata with a theta ii engine.
mine was from a sonata with aftermarket one.
"in 2001 i bought a 1997 sonata it spent more time in the shop than i spent driving it, all sorts of issues."
we have our 8th sonata sitting in the driveway.
i had my nline sonata bumper replaced (thru insurance) and the bill came up to 1700$ cad + labor.
but none of the new sonatas have more ( or even the same) horsepower as mine either.
every sonata after mine has had a significant amount less hp.
"30 days til i sell my sonata, then i will happily never own a hyundai again."
2014 sonata?
com/kr/ko/e/vehicles/sonata-the-edge/gallery if anyone is interested
"if weâ€™re just talking numbers here, the n-line sonata has 290hp which is more then what yours has."
i know you drive a sonata but still
my 2014 sonata hybrid has 220k+ km and just won't get old.
i own a â€˜10 tucson and â€˜13 sonata and i havenâ€™t had any issues whatsoever.
prob wonâ€™t happen as sonata is being discontinued but would be great if they made an exit with a â€˜25 sonata n.
i don't plan on buying another one after my sonata kicks the bucket.
i have a 2019 sonata and i personally canâ€™t stand the newer versions looks.
"of course man, the 2020 sonata does not look like a $22k car especially in the gold color, so i'm worried some ignorant fool is just gonna see the hyundai logo and try to smash."
my 2012 sonata is a fix one thing and another thing breaks kinda deal and iâ€™m so damn sick of it.
the sales numbers after the refresh will most likely decide the sonataâ€™s fate
"when i purchased my sonata in 2017, i was aware of the engine issues, but of course it hadn't reached the level we know now."
"i have a 2020 sonata hybrid and i had to bring it in for major repairs to replace the 12v battery, dc converter, and battery modulator."
i have 25k miles on my sonata with rotations every time and i need new tires soon.
"i own a 2016 sonata se, itâ€™s started to burn oil ~95k mark."
"itâ€™s the fact that iâ€™m left reading all these sonata horror stories online about people experiencing engine failure and a massive recall that scared me, honestly without these stories i wouldnâ€™t really be worried about the future of the car."
i had a 2014 sonata limited with the theta ii engine.
recently got a 2020 sonata limited and still have no complaints.
"no, theyâ€™re not professional thieves and theyâ€™re not targeting a sonatas   theyâ€™re tiktok idiots doing a challenge for the lulz so theyâ€™re just looking for kia and hyundai badged cars to steal by jamming something into the ignition."
my 2018 sonata (75k) is burning oil like a champ.
it's definitely not butter smooth as my old 6 speed in my 2013 sonata.
"well, i had planned on pulling the trigger on a 23 sonata n-line, but i can wait."
i hated the 4spoke steering wheel in my sonata.
i have a hyundai sonata 2013 with 79k.
plus there are some engine recalls for the hyundai sonata so maybe iâ€™ll get some help.
"i'm jealous
  i don't know what to do with my pos 2015 sonata."
"â€œthe hyundai brand says 4 million of its vehicles are affected, from 2011 elantras, tucsons, and sonatas to 2022 accents, konas, and santa fes."
the 2020-23 sonatas were very polarizing.
i just sold my 2022 hyundai sonata hybrid limited yesterday.
who is out there stealing sonata's?
my wife's 2012 turbo sonata had the defective engine and went kablooey with just 68k miles on it.
"doing a quick search, the sonata has this module, while the kona does not."
i had a 2012 hyundai sonata and it took them forever to roll out the recall but i never got a notice.
new engine and power train setup so itâ€™s not the same as what was in your sonata.
"admittedly, most were traded/returned while still quite young, but i did have a sonata for over 100k."
my 17 sonata was burning a quart every 600 miles.
5k for sonata n lines.
i got stranded in the middle of buttfck nowhere in nevada in my 2017 hyundai sonata this past summer.
the tires on your 2020 sonata likely come with a similar warranty.
"as someone that's in the sonata market, after a few days of looking at this car vs the current car, the initial ""wow factor"" is gone and the front end is leaving me feeling like the drl, flat."
"iâ€™ve had a 2012 sonata gls, a 2016 sonata sport, a 2021 sonata limited and now a 2021 sonata n line."
"i have a 2009 hyundai sonata (white paint peeling, thereâ€™s a recall but i donâ€™t qualify), 2013 hyundai sonata limited 2."
"no, iâ€™ve owned a 2013 sonata turbo, 2010 genesis, and 2016 tucson."
i put 80k on the sonata before it was totaled.
"my son bought a 2011 hyundai sonata used at 105,000 miles the engine went they replaced it free of charge and gave him a rental in the interim"
