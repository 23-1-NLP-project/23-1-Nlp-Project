"iâ€™ve owned a 2002 kia rio, 09  hyundai accent, and a 2019 elantra."
"i didnâ€™t have the elantra long enough to have much to say about it (tree fell on the car) but i will say the rio was excellent, and the accent was also good."
"after the elantra was hit by the tree, we got my wife a 2016 kia soul."
"it used be bad but their redesigned elantra, sonata, tucson, santa fe, ioniq5 are doing great!"
"i had a 2011 accent, my wife is still going strong with her 2013 elantra, my sister has leased 5 different hyundai elantra/sonatas over the last 10 years, and my mom had a 2006 sonata that was great until mice got into it."
"had accent in college, elantra after that."
"while i have no problems with my current elantra, my next car will be a mid 2000's toyota."
i got a 2017 elantra se new in 2016.
in fact that car was so reliable and solid that i  got my wife a 2021 elantra hybrid limited.
i have a 2019 elantra.
thatâ€™s how it feels with my new vehicle - an elantra n.
i wish the elantra had this digital dash design looks really cool.
had a hyundai elantra 2016.
been telling folks the elantra n is a much better deal than the new type r coming out.
"it is a great, fun daily car and i really have not had any service issue on any of my elantras."
i have 2014 elantra coupe 80 000 km.
from what i have seen elantra is the best vehicle hyundai makes and their suvs tend to be the ones with problems.
iâ€™m happy with my elantras and would recommend them.
to clarify i have 2019 elantra gt
0l in the 2023 elantra so it hasnâ€™t proved to be bad time will tell.
i keep my 2018 elantra gt sport in sport mode.
atleast in my elantra you can.
5k on an elantra.
"i got a 2021 elantra sel and i get 61 mpg, trust me i was as surprised as you are."
my 2019 elantra gt n-line is fun.
"i have 2 hyundaiâ€™s right now, a 2016 santa fe sport and a 2017 elantra."
i just got the update and tested it and both of my mirrors work on my 2019 elantra.
since i have bought a 22 elantra and a 22 tucson.
last august i looked at an entry elantra in my city.
my 21 elantra with 16.
"that's unfortunate,  i've received the best service from the dealership on my 2014 elantra than any other dealership i've ever dealt with."
"i have a set of x-ices on my 2013 elantra, best winter tires i've ever had, honestly."
picked an 2022 elantra preferred this year.
bought a 2017 hyundai elantra se with 16k miles in 2019.
i've had my '14 elantra gt since '17 and have put 86k miles on it since then.
"honda, vw, mazdaâ€¦i
quite like my â€˜21 elantra n line."
"i
wasnâ€™t able to test drive the vw or the mazda but the elantra beat the honda civic sport touring, for me."
"just got an elantra n line, perfect car for me not worried about thefts at all."
when i had my 2018 elantra i loved it at first but then as i saw more and more civics it made me regret it luckily somebody stole it and totaled it and iâ€™m much happier with my civic
elantra from ohio ðŸ’€
i also got a new 2017 elantra se in 2016 (automatic).
"the software upgrade will be available first for 2017-2020 elantra, 2015-2019 sonata, and 2020-2021 venue vehicles."
2020 elantra gt.
7k for elantra n.
[reminds me of the elantra where this large space with a circle is](https://imgur.
best car iâ€™ve ever had was an elantra i leased back in 2015.
"based on how much my wife likes her (too small for me to be comfortable in) kia soul and how much i liked the elantra, i would not hesitate when the time comes in the next 3/4 years to trade our ancient sienna for a hyundai or kia (probably either a tucson hybrid or sportage hybrid)."
i have a 2020 elantra and i love it.
2018 elantra gt.
the 2024 elantra looks like a kia in my opinion but this design is insanely cool!
iâ€™ve had my 19â€™ elantra for about a year now and i love it.
