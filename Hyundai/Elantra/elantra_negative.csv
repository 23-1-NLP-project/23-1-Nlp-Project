"my wife has gone escort-corolla-mazda5-soul over the years, while i’ve gone protege-lancer-elantra-sienna."
it’s a known issue for elantra gts they just released an updated update for elantra gts go back to the dealer and have them do it should not be charged to redo the update
i have a 22 elantra limited.
my 2017 elantra which i inherited from my late father stalls out at low speeds and they refused to honor the warranty while it was under his own name.
"i had a 13 sonata limited, hated the way the new sonatas look , so i went for the elantra limited hybrid."
but my 23 elantra hybrid blue and other lower trims get kumho solus.
"i bought a used elantra, kept it for 2."
i like my elantra but i’m not buying another hyundai.

they just went to elantra style for the led headlights
i know they are aware of the issue on the 2018 elantra gt's and have a fix.
the same exact thing happened with my 2013 elantra.
i tried them they were charging 5k up on elantras last november.
prolly not buying hyundai again after 3 elantras.
"i have a 2017 elantra and a 2022 elantra hybrid, the 2017 just had its first problem which was a cheap and easy fix (ignition coil)."
my friend who has a 2018 hyundai elantra got a free software update.
2015 elantra gt (blown engine @80k) and 2017 sonata se with fouling spark plugs and charging them daily bad oil consumption (@78k)
i am currently getting a window replaced from an attempt to steal my elantra yesterday.
this was a big reason why i decided to trade my old 2018 elantra in.
if you want to go there i’d probably be pissed off at the world too if i had to drive an elantra
2013 elantra then a 2017 tucson sport (my commuter) and i just got my fiancée a 2022 palisade fully loaded
"i have a 2016 elantra sport i bought new: 9 months after purchase the ac compressor died, had the catastrophic engine failure at ~56k miles, then almost exactly a year and 10k miles later the clutch went out."
i assume you mean elantra gt since you have rear wipers.
"a 2021 hyundai elantra had a starting price of $19,650 but did not include the engine immobilizer."
they showed me a 21 elantra dirty said it was because stickers just came off.
"i think i was the third or fourth owner of my 08 elantra, a former fleet vehicle, i completely neglected to maintain it and it chugged along to 170k miles."
i tried it on my elantra with the software update and it will not start 30 seconds after it has been locked with the fob even with the key in the ignition.
"its a shame because i like the look of the optimas, k5, elantra, and sonata."
"i hear issues, but i have a 2018 elantra value edition and ive had zero issues."
i really dislike the current sonata and elantra.
they seemed to have lost their way after my 2018 elantra.
if the new elantra is a smaller version of this and the n-line is still a turbo with a manual then i'd be interested.
i felt the same way you did when my 2019 elantra blue link was up.
"for example, if *every* 2018 elantra had tpms issues and rear wiper issues after the update, and *every* 2019 kona had steering wheel control problems and mirror issues, then yeah i'd say its the code, but if the problems aren't uniform and on *every* vehicle that's updated, it's probably not a code issue related to the update."
i traded that in for a 2018 elantra sel and it's consuming oil.
im sade with 22 elantra than
i thought it looked like an elantra the last couple of years
"i have a 2014 elantra limited, and sometimes i love my car, and other times i wish it was more sporty."
"i actually have a 21 elantra, but in 5 years it’s gonna be a pain."
"my 05 elantra got 64,000 when the rod went through the block."
oh this is dope wish i hadn't bought the 23 elantra and should have actually waited for this lol.
i gave our elantra back to the bank because the whole thing went to pot.
"i just put a deposit on a 2013 elantra with 50k miles, feeling like i should maybe ask for the deposit back?"
does the baseline elantra in canada have an immobilizer?
"made the the dealership take engine photos and track down every oil change i got, but now i’m driving a 2023 hybrid elantra loaner while they wait 5 months to get a engine replacement…
so, maybe yea, but sell the thing before you hit that 100k mark."
i didnt even consider hyundai until last year reading elantra reviews.
you sound like you raced a elantra n and got gapped so hard in your mdx you had to come here and cry lol
‘22 elantra n line has stick.
so a base line elantra in canada is less prone to theft than a base line for the usa.
i had an 03 elantra 5 spd.
and then i had an 05 elantra gt hatch and they both died the same way.
"2017 hyundai elantra se, hyundai won’t do anything about it."
"net/products/nissan-multi-point-inspection-forms) 

but when i've taken my hyundai elantra to two different hyundai dealerships, both of them just give me a receipt saying that a multi-point inspection was done."
my 2022 kona limited was parked next to our 2020 elantra when it was stolen.
i have a 2017 elantra gt and waiting three weeks now for a new replacement engine.
i don’t mind the car so much (21 elantra) as so much i hate the dealer.
elantra n literally dealing with a recall rn lol
idk i bought my elantra n on june 24th.
"if you can't get 40mpg in an elantra, you're something wrong."
my 2017 elantra went at almost 84k miles.
even specific hyundai elantra subforums has nothing on this issue that i could find.
"i've had 3 now bought from new 2014 elantra gt, 2019 veloster n, and now a 2022 hyundai tuscon hybrid."
"it isn’t the one that sold me the car because the elantra gt n-line only sold here 2019-2020, and a lot of dealers never got them."
"“the hyundai brand says 4 million of its vehicles are affected, from 2011 elantras, tucsons, and sonatas to 2022 accents, konas, and santa fes."
i’ve had an elantra 2015 and now a 17 santa fe sport both crossed over 100k.
"i have a 2019 elantra @ 70k miles and no issues (yet) with oil consumption but seeing how hyundai treats their customers down on their luck, i don’t feel inclined to give them my business in the future."
"so, hyundai accent lc/lc2, gk tiburon, getz, hd elantra, etc."
not liking the current ivt or dcts in the new forte or elantra either.
"yeah, it looks like an elantra on steroids."
i had a 2020 elantra and when i found out about all this i traded in for a 2022 with an immobilizer.
"my 2022 elantra came with kumho solus ta31 tires, which come with a 60k mile treadwear warranty."
do you have the regular elantra or the gt?
my 18 elantra w/ 140k miles still gets 38-40 highway used to be around 44 when i got it
just picked up a 23 elantra sel and i prob would’ve got this instead but whatever.
when i was buying my elantra  dealers all around were charging 3-6k mark up.
ended up finding a couple dealerships without the mark up and now i got my elantra at msrp.
i came here looking for info on an elantra gt n-line/forte5 gt as a second car and i've never ever heard of anyone wanting an engine replacement until i came here.
this would explain why it happened in the other loaner elantra as well.
even the goodyear tires on the elantra n line?
"after the experience with my 21 elantra shutting off while driving and the treatment i received from hyundai while 25 days without a vehicle i will never buy another hyundai again, as well as i went from recommending them to everyone, to telling everyone to stay away from them."
i drove 100 miles to get my elantra gt n-line to a dealership not on that map.
