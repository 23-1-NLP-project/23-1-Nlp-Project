if hyundai dealer or corporate dealt with these engines without causing people stress i would agree with you then.
the ones by me have really had no problems replacing engines for people.
"its designed by korean engineers and made for korean vehicles, plus hyundai is starting to use their technology in cars."
in canada it was more of hyundai telling the courts what an excellent corporate citizen they were amd promising to deal with the engines appropriately.
your engine had a good life.
nah you’re right about hyundai’s engines.
"i had never hyundai after the theta ii fiasco, yet here i am with a 2021 sf with the newer smartstream engine."
theta2 engines.
"(fwiw, i don't lock my cars or house, i rely on people not being assholes, and it's worked out so far)

and i love how you put down nissan transmissions while not mentioning the utter trash that is a hyundai engine."
then they should start with making reliable engines and transmissions.
it's up to the product managers and project managers to flow down the right requirements to the engineering team.
complete engine failure due to the oil loss and the diagnostics on the app told me it was running just fine.
"which is funny, because i just had my engine replaced last year because of a recall, and i believe my car should qualify for this new one as well."
the first smartstream engine was built in 2011.
these are very good engines especially with a 1.
6 l turbo smartstream engine ii.
i'm not saying that hyundai/kia doesn't have engine issues on the older style engines but my point is they are covering a lot of them.
"your engine did not fail because you didn't do their ""induction cleaning""   they are blowing smoke yo your butt trying to get a couple thousand dollars out of you before they eventually replace the engine!"
4l engine.
"aside from a complete engine tear down and rebuild, all their diagnostics and hyundai‘s diagnostics said my engine was fine."
"first, honda is the largest engine manufacturer in the world."
"it's affordable, kills the engine and has other nice features."
"will the engine last more than 58,000 miles and will the driver side seat stay together and will the white ones have paint that peels and crack after about 3 years?"
their engines pop all the time.
toyotalexus and hondaacura are the last 2 engineered and reliable car manufacturers left in the world.
hyundai’s quality is very good if you’re not one of the thousands who’ve had engine issues.
"you can't trust it anymore, you can't look at it without seeing engine failure and instability anymore."
right now kia is having major engine problems and doing everything they can to hide it but it'll come out eventually.
they make their own engines and produce their own batteries.
"finally, they still will produce hybrid engine cars."
i’ve heard about the engine one.
"looking at it scientifically, through the laws of symmetry and human-machine interaction engineering design(ergonomics), the new design is better."
"funny, i have a master in mechanical engineering too, and yes, you’re right."
so yes their engineering is still a big question mark.
5l engine and six speed auto for more than a decade now so at this point it's well proven.
they also had a couple reports on the trash theta engines that like to catch on fire.
5l engine has been great.
"hyundai replaced my engine without a hassle, my car re-sale value is fairly stable, my auto insurance renewed in october with no increase, and the 5 hyundai dealers near me are all still in business."
"how they going to balance quality engineering, the beautiful luxurious interiors, build quality, and price."
try building engines and transmissions that don't fail before 10k miles.
hyundai cars are pretty solid beyond their engines.
because the engines are still dogshit and that's extremely important.
and the turbo engine in hyundai’s are fairly new compared to the “bulletproof” hybrid engines that toyota has pretty much perfected.
luckily my 2014 never burned oil or had engine issues even with a theta ii.
"h/k's theta engines were developed in 2007, with the theta ii being introduced in 2009/2010 and theta iii in 2018."
it's a fantastic engine that can handle a lot of hp.
"they put that engine in most of their performance/eco vehicles, especially use it in wrc events."
