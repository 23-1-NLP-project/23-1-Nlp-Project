there is a lot of good things about the vehicles but the engine problems for the engines you listed have  not been blown out of proportion.
"they also don't recall: engines that fail at very low miles, burning 2 quarts of oil brand new, spontaneously combustion cars, cars that go on fire when not even running, early mileage transmission failures, crankshafts out of  tolerance, steering wheels coming off while driving, ect."
"8l engines too

engine supposedly had problems in korea but except of the hate hyundai sites don't see many issues with it.
"missed the thetw engines and still going strong after a decade and 100,000 plus miles."
you replaced engine twice before 100k miles.
"long story short, i traded in the car before it totally shit the bed once i realized they were never gonna replace the engine."
you own a hyundai so you should google hyundai and kia problems and engine failures.
"ford has engines that seize with under 5k miles, it's not just a hyundai thing."
i've got a lot older vehicles with original engines that i don't have to even check the oil between changes.
"because i was driving a 6yr old hyundai w/ less than 60k miles and the engine failed, dropping me from 70mph to 20mph."
"wait, both needed new engines and transmissions?"
3 months to schedule an engine check.
the engine will break by then so we left it.
"the corolla, lancer, and sienna have cost us about 35k combined in repairs outside of normal maintenance, of which 24k was engine related and 5k hvac related."
"the other vehicles have cost us less than 5k total in combined repairs, none of which have been engine repairs or other repairs requiring more than an afternoon at the shop."
"i had to have the engine replaced on it two years ago, at a cost of about 12k."
name one automaker with more dead engines lol
that may be true but they also deliberately built cars that don’t include an ‘engine immobilizer’.
my friend had his kia engine die also.
"it's all puzzle pieces between engine's power band, gearing, tire/wheel size, etc."
"now i do live in an extremely hot area in the summer, and i understand all turbo engines uses the oil to cool it down, so there are naturally more oil consumption needed."
the engineers knew how easy it was to steal these cars and hoping that no one would find out.
he’s done over 100 engine swaps since last january.
"however, the engine issues (with the theta ii and oil consumption on other models) and some transmission issues (though much smaller in occurrence than engines), combined with how the repair is handled (time to get parts, time to repair, whether there’s a loaner in situations that take time and result in loss-of-use), if poor, all reflect on hyundai to the average buyer."
"further yet, people with theta ii engine issues had such a poor experience that the nhtsa fined hyundai extra for not processing the recall in a timely manner."
5 years and never had anything but check engine lights always turn on every few months.
finally traded it in for a mazda cx5 when dealership wanted 4k to fix the latest engine issue.
"those engines should last 300, 400, 500,000 miles now."
have you heard of the engine issues that required replacement (but only if you knew to ask about it)?

my engine was replaced in 2020.
"serious folks, let's wait until they sort out thier engine and transmission engineering failures before we expect them to build a complicated awd transmission."
that things gonna be riddled with engineering defects from day one.
"the newer ones we have lasted 6,000 miles (santa fe) and 45,000 (tucson) before needing new engines and transmissions."
com/news/hyundai-elantra-1-8l-nu-engine-class-action-settlement/
"#general motors

gm recalled nearly 6 million vehicles to repair an ignition switch defect that caused car engines to suddenly shut off while driving."
"from exploding seatbelt airbags, down to structurally compromised engine mounts, there’s always been fuck ups in the car business, it’s almost as if multibillion dollar corporations couldn’t give a crap about consumers, if it meant saving a few bucks."
i believe with usa suit hyundai was court ordered to deal with the engines which judging by the posts means that they'll piss ass around with oil consumption texts and the like to get some cash off you buy once the engine goes boom they'll deal with it.
"which involves doing all the oil consumption texts, scoping the engines, and anything else the dealers can do to make a few bucks and then turning people done if they can find any reason to do so but helping the cases they'd have the biggest problems denying and them saying "" look at us, aren't we wonderful""."
"toyota engines are terrible, they have been burning oil for decades, especially the 4 cylinders."
these engines go out fast and usually after service.
engine stalled.
the engine oil problem is famous with a lot of hyundai vehicles.
a few months pre-pandemic my 2014 sonata engine seized several hours from home right at about 92k miles.
the only positive was the very small local dealership that hyundai required me to have it towed to and they performed the engine exchange was helpful.
some of these engines are burning a quart every 500 miles.
"3 chevy engines, they were a bad batch."
except with chevy no one thinks one bad engine = a shit brand because it’s a chevy.
"for an engine to last you need

changle oil every year or 7500-8500km on gasoline engines alongside the filter
change the oil after the first 1000km to get rid of possible filings."
"now, how many of those engines that stalled/broke were within that schedule?"
"then you add that, usa has different engines because people like larger displacement."
those engines are designed and produced only for usa.
"and to add on the above, there is no engine above 1800cc/4cyl that wont burn oil, turbo or not."
4l engine without changing or even filling oil.
engine had to be replaced because white smoke was coming from the rear.
"not even 24 hours after the dealer replaced the engine, same thing happened."
"so if it is normal behavior, why did you replace the engine?"
we replace engines all the time for oil consumption.
for a long time i thought all cars in the 2000s had at least a engine immobilizer and i guess hyundai went the cheap route.
"my family is on their 5th, only replaced one engine at no cost."
"it was the notorious engine problem, which is what it is."
chevy currently has problems with some of its engines now.
"i mean, they're piping in artificial engine sound in a lot of cars, and evs are straight up playing sound tracks."
im a fan but am i gonna get my unlimited engine warranty with all the recalls of my 2012 sonata
"to be fair, these newer engines haven't been around long enough to know if there are any issues on them."
the 2013-2014 engines didn't start displaying issues until like 2020.
2015 elantra gt (blown engine @80k) and 2017 sonata se with fouling spark plugs and charging them daily bad oil consumption (@78k)
in no way do i think my engine issues are because of some error on my part.
replaced more of their engines than i can count.
"you would think the theta engine issue would give them a kick up the ass to sort this stuff out, and i figured their extended warranty is them backing themselves that they have finally got to the bottom of their problems, but it sounds like they haven't."
"and unlike hyundaikia, they don't spontaneously go on fire, the steering wheel doesn't fall off when you're driving, the engines and transmissions last longer than 10k miles, and don't come action packed with recalls and class action lawsuits."
engines died before 30k miles or battery died within warranty?
but the amount of engine replacements i see on this sub is nuts.
i don’t like how they’ve handled the immobilizer issue and i have seen problems starting with the nu engines of other people.
"i have a 2016 elantra sport i bought new: 9 months after purchase the ac compressor died, had the catastrophic engine failure at ~56k miles, then almost exactly a year and 10k miles later the clutch went out."
and the recent one  they double filled the  engine oil.
"my opinion has always been if you open the engine up like that you should change the oil, especially in a leak situation so you know that it’s 100% full and ready to go."
i guess you haven't heard of the hyundai engine failure class action?
org/blog/new-hyundai-kia-engine-failure-settlement-covers-2m-additional-vehicles](https://www.
"org/blog/new-hyundai-kia-engine-failure-settlement-covers-2m-additional-vehicles)

or how about the excessive oil consumption lawsuit?"
"""infotainment screen is confusing to use"" (yes, that somehow counts as ""reliability"", even though it makes no sense) counts the same as ""my engine caught on fire"", because they're only reporting problem frequency, and don't weight major problems more heavily than trivial ones."
"i mean, if you want to include **all** recalls, let’s not forget these gems from hyundai/kia:

theta ii engine failures and class action lawsuit, abs module leak in santa fe’s that’s a fire risk, trailer hitch wiring harness fire risk in santa fe’s and pallisade’s, 7-speed dct class action lawsuit, 8-speed dct recall for faulty pcb that kills the transmission (hyundai won’t preemptively replace them, only will replace it after it fails and leaves you stranded)."
"and again you fail you recognize regulator’s role here or the fact this wasn’t an issue when the car initially came out but once it was spread to bored degenerates via tiktok it became a problem several years later

and how do you know engineers did this intentionally knowing how easy they were to steal?"
"this car was engineered in korea, they don’t have immobilizers on base lines."
"i did not have the theta engine, but my 2016 hyundai tucson ended up having the oil consumption issue and kicked the can last week."
"when i spoke to the hyundai dealership, they basically told me it’s probably best if i just get rid of the car, unless i wanted to pay $10-12k for a new engine and wait about 3 months for the engine to come in."
either way i’d at least look into that because i have done several engines for various warranty companies sold by other manufacturer’s dealerships.
"so they replaced the knock sensor fully and then after it being replaced the engine began knocking, and they’re confirming it is the engine bearings."
"my 2022 santa engine blew up, the bluetooth rarely connects,, apple care play is a joke, the immediate break if someone almost goes into the side of me on the highway scares the crap out of me and if i am on the phone and hang up sometimes it won’t so i have no radio, phone or navigation…."
"they are in the process of replacing the engine due to the recall, but any communication from them has been nonexistent."
hyundai purposely sold so many cars with bad engines!
"i bought a 2013 from this dealership and i got 45900 out of the 1st engine then got 95,000 out of the second engine!"
4 engines in these junk cars!
"a 2021 hyundai elantra had a starting price of $19,650 but did not include the engine immobilizer."
"the price difference is negligible between these cars  even though the 2021 toyota corolla includes the engine immobilizer security, similar features, similar fuel economy, better reliability, better fit and finish, way better reputation, and even better resale value."
"now that being said, 2018 sonata’s are not yet part of the massive engine repair recall."
because my car engine shuts off while driving and hyundai has been absolutely shit throughout the experience.
lol because their engines are pieces of shit.
"” no i will do the work and i told you specifically not to pull this bullshit, fix the damn engine and dont call me again with this bullshit."
btw the issue is usually not the engineering design team.
my entire engine had to be recalled.
i have a 2018 turbo sport sonata (third engine replacement since it was built) when i got my car back my whole entire fuel pump was out.
i asked if i could just trade my car in since i have a faulty car with a faulty engine that they don't even make anymore.
"they had to put the same kind of engine in the car and if it breaks down again, then i have a new car that is completely broke down and i don't have $7,000 to put in a new engine if it's past the warranty."
hyundai has some negative press still from recent recalls and engine fires.
there’s the theta ii engine issues and the subsequent botched recall.
there’s the oil consumption lawsuit that affects nearly every hyundai engine since 2012.
most companies don't keep engineers for probably more than 1 or 2 models.
engineers tend to move from company to company.
"furthermore, was paying monthly fees for the app with engine check ups and diagnostics."
"i owned a 2014 veloster that was good too me for 3-4 years until it suffered from engine failure by year 1 at 60k miles, lol."
the car didn't drive the same ever since after i replaced the engine.
"any car can be stolen, but with the engine immobilizer it is very difficult to steal."
"not every hyundai owner i know has had a blown engine, but a lot of them have (myself included)."
because kia/hyundai have made some terrible engines and refuse to back their products even after recall.
i've sworn to never even look at a hyundai/kia/genesis after they refused to honor an engine recall for my ex wife
i had an a 17 sonata that the engine went.
but if i personally had the grenading engine issues i would probably think twice about buying another.
"the sportage, tucson, santa fe all use a smartstream engine ii build in 2019."
none of these cars are built with a theta ii engine.
"com/business/press-releases/2022-us-vehicle-dependability-study)

yep we got major engine issues on older vehicles  but i have never seen any other manufacturers that have  actually taken care of these issues with warranty extensions like kia/hyundai."
i've been in the business since 2008 and i can't think of any else who been putting something comparable to an engine in vehicles with over 100k miles other than toyota with the frames.
i think cars catching on fire and engines exploding are top priority right now 😳
"of course you should care, the new engine lineup has nothing to do with the older theta engines."
i feel eco pushes my tuscon to behave tougher on engine.
hyundia has had more than it's market share of engine problems and doesn't want to really do much about it.
so we gonna pretend honda didn’t have any engine issues?
engine issues.
also they are facing a class action lawsuit for 2018-2023 already due to the engine issues.
4l engines from a certain family of engines is notorious for breaking down.
in which case the engineering team are idiots.
"5k miles has been in the shop a total of 8 days, 3 different times, for my engine cutting off and going into accessory while driving."
engines i can't think of one.
0t genesis g70 is not recalled because its engine was built in korea while a 2.
0t sonata or optima will have the same engine but built in the us with the potential defect (metal shaving residue left after machining the cylinders).
"the engine required replacement at just 7,000 miles, then again at 96,000 miles."
after my 2017 with 60k miles engine seized out of no where and took 4 months to replace engine under warranty?
both kia and hyundai are having the same problems with their engines.
"i thought the headline was going to be more like ""are y'all still buying hyundai and kia after seeing so many of their engines blow up?"
then they tried to not warranty the engine without proof of his last five oil changes despite him only having like 40k miles on it.
"then, it took like eight months to finally get a new engine."
it’s almost as if there was a portal to narnia in my engine somewhere siphoning off oil a little bit at a time.
it’s about a sonata with a theta ii engine.

"have fun""

you can buy a kit to disable the engine or a magnet powered switch to kill the ecm power."
4 gdi engine recalls probably
"pretty self explanatory, what with all the early engine failures, fires, burning oil, steering wheels falling off, class action lawsuits, recalls."
"my ‘22 was fine as a peach for 7k miles, then it blew on a road trip - it’s been almost 5 months since but it’s finally in for a refurbished engine."
"look at all the lawsuits for exploding engines, defects & all the other problems"
coming from engineering perspective they honestly don’t care bout you either
"i’m aware of older models, but i have heard none- very little about newer models outside of a few manual drivers that are new to manual and have blown their engines."
i’m not a technician and unfortunately don’t know which engine belongs to which vehicle.
unless there are signs of neglect they will cover the engine if a rod bearing goes.
90% of them have engine isses.
even new hyundai / kia  have engine and fire issues.
more of the theta ii engines and i think there was another one that some people were unlucky with along with fires.
">can you let us know which other car brands didn’t include in mobilizers in their cars 

every hyundai i've owned included engine mobilizers."
"because hyundais are overall cheap cars which is a plus for people who need a new car but overall the quality of hyundais are pretty bad

they’re doing great things don’t get me wrong i love what they’re doing but they need to up the quality of engines and materials they use."
you can't seriously not know about hyundai engines.
almost every 4cyl equipped car has a recall out for the engine and every year newer models keep getting added to it.
the engines have been trash for the past decade and have not improved.
"ask the hyundaikia mechanic, that owns a hyundaikia, about the new hyundaikia he bought and the engine failed at just a few thousand miles."
you’re forgetting the whole “seized engine” thing.
there are $25 engine immobilizers available on amazon.
mazdaspeed engines say otherwise
0 nu gdi engine?
">people are losing their cars because of you,  their motors are going to shit, blowing engines,burning up  the fact you're radio does not remember what you personally like to listen to is pretty far down the totem pole, is my guess."
engines blowing up?
"people are losing their cars because of you,  their motors are going to shit, blowing engines,burning up  the fact you're radio does not remember what you personally like to listen to is pretty far down the totem pole, is my guess."
hyundaikia are engineered by accountants that never took math courses in college besides basic addiction and subtraction.
that's where you showed everyone your lack of familiarity with cars and engineering.
"ford pinto catching fire if rear ended, vw fox chopping people’s finger when adjusting the seat, chevrolet vega notorious for engine failure and rusting like there’s no tomorrow, to name a few… and this doesn’t apply only to cars, samsung note catching fire?"
poor build quality poor materials poor engineering.
engine seized randomly at mid to low mileage = dealer issue?
how about finding a vehicle that doesn’t have engines seized so easily?
"fwiw, as a 2013 azera owner, who’s car had the engine/oil issues at 97k miles…."
"made the the dealership take engine photos and track down every oil change i got, but now i’m driving a 2023 hybrid elantra loaner while they wait 5 months to get a engine replacement…
so, maybe yea, but sell the thing before you hit that 100k mark."
engine problems?
"i really did love the hyundais and everything they were, until i had engine failure at one of the worst times in my life."
2 of the 4 had engine failure.
don’t jd power and similar dependability studies take engine life into account?
what makes you say that the newer engines are still dog shit?
"with all the engine problems both hyundai and kia are having, i think you'll see a drop in repeat buyers and reputation."
i dont need it i just found an article on jalopnik or something discussing the markups on the engine immobilizer bought through dealership even above the markup for same product elsewhere and the price hyundai announced.
"because even if the new engines are great, there is still a massive amount of previous gen engines on the road that are dying far to early, which in turn has the owners on the internet telling their stories."
"mine at the dealership as well, engine misfire under 20k miles."
also the garbage engines are another reason i’ll never buy another one.
"when i purchased my sonata in 2017, i was aware of the engine issues, but of course it hadn't reached the level we know now."
"engines dying, new engines burning excess oil, poor build quality."
they replaced your engine in a day?
engine was losing oil with no leaks/blue smoke.
"sorry to hear your engine failed too, mine failed at 74k miles."
i'm upvoting you because my heart nearly gave out when my engine on my 2015 died and was at 125k miles and still 5k left on payments working at walmart so there's no way i could have afforded to fix it if hyundai hadn't claimed full responsibility.
especially that they are making it very difficult for me to get an engine replacement.
i have a 2017 elantra gt and waiting three weeks now for a new replacement engine.
"so i say i’ll test drive it anyway since the engine would still be the same but lo and behold there’s barely any gas in the tank, like running on fumes."
the gdi theta ii engine was such a horrendous failure that hyundai has a class action lawsuit against them for it and continue to make garbage.
except for the part where his hyundais engine seized while still under warranty.
5 million and counting vehicles recalled for engine fires.
engines just failing are a common thread as well.
"it’s the fact that i’m left reading all these sonata horror stories online about people experiencing engine failure and a massive recall that scared me, honestly without these stories i wouldn’t really be worried about the future of the car."
i’m probably looking elsewhere for my next car solely because of the theta 2 engine.
my opinion might change if say my engine failed and my dealer dealt with it very well.
"ford f150 had a ""injector bleed down"" issue that destroyed many many engines."
i had a 2014 sonata limited with the theta ii engine.
did you get a new engine?
"i know your link has a factory fob option, but at least mykey is designed for korean vehicles by korean engineers."
"theta ii engine issues but they definitely made all kia and hyundai vehicles a target because of the theft issues, regardless of year model."
four months waiting for the engine to be replaced in his hyundai with no rental car or loaner.
"nice car, mine is well built, but i will not buy another one after all the engine problems they had."
because they had engines catching on fire
prolly gonna tell me to get a new engine.
"after the engine debacle, i don’t have a lot of trust."
my engine went kapoot last week
is it concerning that your car is 2 years old and already needs engine replacement?
or do i keep it because the engine is probably going to last a while?
if only they can make their engines last over 100k miles.
"i want nothing more than to ditch internal combustion engines forever, but not only is the charging infrastructure for ev's still abysmally unreliable, but it's appalling how many hazardous materials are required to make the batteries for them."
"prior to engine immobilizers being a thing, in order to bypass the lock cylinder, you would need to effectively disassemble the entire steering column."
plus there are some engine recalls for the hyundai sonata so maybe i’ll get some help.
anyway hyundai rejected my request for repair or an engine replacement.
basically your engine have to seize on you while driving for you to qualify for engine replacement or repair.
you are basically rolling the dice when you buy a hyundai cause you never know if you’ll end up with a bad engine.
the problem isn't the engineering design.
they had to replace the engine after only a year.
"not even 24 hours after the engine got replaced, visible smoke from the rear of the car."
i personally had to have honda usa buy a 2007 civic back from me when i bought it brand new because the engine kept getting a misfire that they couldn’t fix.
my wife's 2012 turbo sonata had the defective engine and went kablooey with just 68k miles on it.
"not only with the engine issues, but the engine immobilizer and alarm issues what really piss me off."
engine noise cannot be heard [at times] until the p1326 knock sensor code is cleared since the rpms are limited.
new engine and power train setup so it’s not the same as what was in your sonata.
"i would argue they peaked in the late 2000s, because everything went to hell in 2011 with the theta ii and nu engines."
"hyundai-kia had to be sued to cover the widespread theta ii and nu engine problems, instead of owning the issues and taking care of customers."
they lost a customer for life with how they handled the theta ii engine and fire issues.
but what about the actual engineering…
they have multiple recalls for seized engines and don’t honor warranty.
they both used the theta ii engine.
nobody mixes up hondas logo with a logo that represents failing engines
stateside had a better result on the class action lawsuit but can still be a pain getting bad engines dealt with from taking to people here.
"but again, these engine and transmission options you have for example for tucson, we don't have at all."
"too many recalls, theta engine, kia boys, crappy dealership experience."
let's hope your engine isn't consuming oil and it's just a mistake
shortly after the engine went.
it helps as evidence for when engine dies and needs replacing under warranty.
"mine goes through 5 qts in 2000 miles, giving that i do have the turbo engine."
the theta ii engines were bad.
i always wondered why my engine seemed quiet after an oil change.
corolla is a tad on the smaller side of the compact segment with a relatively new transmission and impreza has had engine oil burning issues in past generations so that really only leaves mazda 3 who happens to be the only compact that has stuck with a non cvt.
"if they do have the reliability/engineering behind them, i see their prices getting pushed up quite a bit over the next 5 years."
their turbo engines were burning oil.
""" this brand has major quality and engineering issues."
"they also don't recall: engines that fail at very low miles, burning 2 quarts of oil brand new, spontaneously combustion cars, cars that go on fire when not even running, early mileage transmission failures, crankshafts out of  tolerance, steering wheels coming off while driving, ect."
"christ, i work at a western star dealer and we've had to send back a ton of detroit diesel engines (which cost more then a car) for rebuilt and repair."
"ask me how my engine/drivetrain is doing in 5 years and then i'll tell you my opinion on hyundai, my family has had 2 santa fe's."
"1st had problems, burning oil and fuel pump, 2nd had recalled engine problems."
"passed the bct test, they replaced the knock sensor and i'm on my way inching to towards the engine eventually blowing up anyway."
"dealer happened to volunteer the information that this year alone, they replaced about 250 engines."
google around for engine trouble.
0l engine troubles added to the list.
"something about some clearance inside the engine being too tight, resulting in yet again more catastrophic engine failures."
"hyundai-kia's engineering team probably knows that and recommended them at some point, but they were clearly overruled by senior management."
"not exactly what im saying, more so is this engine going to end up with the same problems"
in the market for a hybrid cuv-reason why i chose rav4 hybrid xse over the santa fe hybrid limited came down to 2 things:  spare tire available in a rav4 and the turbo engine in the santa fe.
"if hyundai adds an actual spare tire in the roomy trunk and more reliability data is available for their turbo hybrid engines, i’d have gladly chose the santa fe limited with all the bells and whistles i’d ever want for the next 10 years."
your engine is fried.
you need a new engine.
3 billion dollars last year for their awful engines.
most of their cars are now all re-designed with new engines transmissions hybrid systems and electronics.
"unless there is a check engine light on, a generic obd2 scanner is worthless."
"nope, just got my sante fe back last week, engine replacement at 35k miles."
"i could go into the ongoing multiple recalls, engine replacements, class-action lawsuits and nhtsa investigations for the theta ii/iii engines but that would be a very long post."
i came here looking for info on an elantra gt n-line/forte5 gt as a second car and i've never ever heard of anyone wanting an engine replacement until i came here.
is this a known issue with that engine?
"after how hyundai motor america treated me when my under warranty engine seized, i will never buy another hyundai."
"similiar accident all my dashboard lights are on, no engine light luckily."
the engineering design team didn't think it should be there so they didn't put it there.
hyundai where selling bad engine way into 2018.
that and the engine fires arent helping for sure.
0t (engine recall got it replaced but the engine caused stress on the turbo and i had to pay out of pocket to replace it.
"i was without my car for 4 months), and lastly a 2015 hyundai tucson (engine recall, car broke down in another state."
"they wouldn’t ship to a dealership near me, cover transportation or cover a rental while they received the engine."
not the same engine so no.
heck even the theta engine debacle.
"as many stories as you see on reddit i have multiple friends and i myself have a theta engine car (2017 kia optima ex, 100k miles) and none of us have had any engine issues"
i guess you missed the masters in mechanical engineering part 🤷🏻‍♂️
resell value is low and engine recall is a norm.
"from my understanding, the service department at the hyundai dealership it’s currently at is confirming that is is the engine bearings which exactly is what is covered under warranty."
"unimaginable things happening, like chunks of engine block falling off."
"my son bought a 2011 hyundai sonata used at 105,000 miles the engine went they replaced it free of charge and gave him a rental in the interim"
cylinder deactivation on the j35 makes that specific engine from honda trash.
"i’d still say brand perception, dealership and servicing (some of the worst and shadiest in the country), and the shoddy quality of older cars (engine issues, ability to steal cars that aren’t keyless, cheaper parts compared to newer releases) are not helping them."
