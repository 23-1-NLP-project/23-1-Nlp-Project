not he best as well not designed for it as others where but did ok.
"it used be bad but their redesigned elantra, sonata, tucson, santa fe, ioniq5 are doing great!"
other can learn courage in design from you!
"its designed by korean engineers and made for korean vehicles, plus hyundai is starting to use their technology in cars."
i wish the elantra had this digital dash design looks really cool.
"that catfish maw of the outgoing car was awful, and while this new design is certainly bold and distinct, it does so in a way that looks fresh and modern."
i love this sci-fi design language they’re using these days
i like it but does the sonata have a design that i can look back at previous generations and know that its a sonata?
i don’t think it was until 2020 where they finally found their design language in the sonata.
2020 marked the beginning of sport luxury with design and performance.
when they’re designing a new style every year.
"i don't know about you, but when buying a new car, i don't research the design of the ignition locking mechanism on every car; i just trust that it will take either sophistication or skill to steal my car, which is not the case with these models."
"body construction is great, so is paint, and the interior and features are great too, and i love the design."
they’ve certainly tested this when implementing new designs.
looks more streamlined to me and is a somewhat logical development from the previous design language.
"i purchased a 2018 sonata sel low miles, i specifically wanted this year because of the body style and some design preferences."
the tiktok is focused on how easy these these cars are to steal because of hyundai's design.
"definitely not, but i love the design, it's features, so i willingly paid extra."
design is always a personal thing.
"looking at it scientifically, through the laws of symmetry and human-machine interaction engineering design(ergonomics), the new design is better."
"i got my santa fe has the 3spoke spoke design, which i much prefer."
"hyundai made a cost cutting move that none of their competitors did, and created a design that was incredibly easy to steal."
the 2024 elantra looks like a kia in my opinion but this design is insanely cool!
