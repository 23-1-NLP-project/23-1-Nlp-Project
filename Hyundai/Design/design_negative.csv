remember when hyundai / kia seemed to be ripping off designs from other cars.
now manufacturers cant even keep up with how progressive their designs are.
"since both are completely redesigning their line ups these last years, it might go down a bit but not that much."
hyundai/kia has been absolutely killing it with their designs lately.
"they always seem to change their design heavily every generation (i know this one is a refresh/lci), does the sonata have a true design identity?"
the new redesign?
those engines are designed and produced only for usa.

"noooo ways, the catfish look is definitely the worst design i’ve seen."
"again, it is possible to design a secure locking mechanism without an immobilizer, hyundai simply chose not to."
honda is straight out looking like geriatrics are designing their cars.
btw the issue is usually not the engineering design team.
i'm waiting for the new santa fe to see if i want to pull the trigger  on the redesign or go for the current gen.
the only reason the kia boyz had a subject for their tiktok is because of hyundai's design.
"corporate blamed it on ""manufacturing defects"" but i'd imagine it was just a poor design."
designs are getting better but reliability is still a crap shoot.
"most taps i see are designed to just get power from the fuse block, not break the circuit."
"i know your link has a factory fob option, but at least mykey is designed for korean vehicles by korean engineers."
"case #xxxx causal part # 39133-2epeo

cause

correction

reprogrammed ecm with techline vehicle is now operating as designed this is a straight time claim please see attached tech time punches"
"to be fair, part of the problem is also the design of the lock cylinder."
"with an immobilizer, you don't need to design for that level of security, but if you cheap out and remove the immobilizer, it makes for a giant hole in security."
the problem isn't the engineering design.
hope so but hyundai has not even confirmed they’re bringing the 2024 redesign to the us market.
"hyundai’s design team has been knocking it out of the park, imho."
"their designs are great (especially the k5) but i just don’t trust them personally, and probably never will."
most of their cars are now all re-designed with new engines transmissions hybrid systems and electronics.
"i love the bold and handsome designs and amazing features-packed offerings of the koreans, but time and time again they are (and always have been) let down by atrocious customer service."
the engineering design team didn't think it should be there so they didn't put it there.
