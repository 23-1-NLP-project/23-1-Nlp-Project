but whenever i reached out to dealer they remind me of don ready.
if hyundai dealer or corporate dealt with these engines without causing people stress i would agree with you then.
hyundia service says that's normal.
"i feel that, while they're really ahead of a lot of other manufacturers when it comes to electric vehicles, the overall dealer experience and some of their quality issues will probably keep them from being #1."
hyundai will be offering sales and installation of the kit at its dealers starting on oct.
"mazda, hyundai, and kia have all been great for us (so far) - just wish the local dealer (we have one dealership that holds the local rights for hyundai, kia, mazda, mitsubishi, vw, genesis, toyota, and lexus) wasn‚Äôt so pushy/shady."
experience varies so much from dealer to dealer.
"this is a shame because when backed by a good dealer, it is an excellent buy."
i think my dealership handles their customers appropriately.
"so i moved to toyota, even the dealer sucks i don't have to worry about car breake down suddenly."
"oh no worries there, i'm extremely lucky with my years of hyundai tech service and access to parts basically in a moments notice i had it fixed shortly after."
many eu customers do not have to deal with dealerships at all and buy directly from the manufacturer.
the company and dealerships make customers toil with claims during recalls.
"it is a great, fun daily car and i really have not had any service issue on any of my elantras."
service requirements!
but in todays world of back ordered parts and dealership waits i now know it is a must.
"hmmm interesting to know, in the uk we just take our cars in every 10k miles and the dealers do what they need to do."
my biggest draw is actually the dealership that sold it to us they‚Äôre so far my favorite of the ones i‚Äôve used.
"however, the dealership i went through was awesome."
hyundai does have really nice dealerships though
the dealer is rebutting hyundai for denying the claim and will be updating hopefully soon.
the hyundai dealership i bought from seems ok but the service i got from the toyota dealer for my old car was simply top notch and they offered a free loaner for service appointments.
>every dealer acts on their own.
"while i agree that a lot of this comes down to individual dealerships, i agree with op."
my only saving grace when dealing with the service manager was i‚Äôm a mechanic and i made it very clear up front not to try and bullshit me which they tried anyway.
i decided to do some research and have a friend at a dealer and drove tons of different cars.
i also have a fantastic hyundai service dept i take it to and do all the factory maintenance.
"luckily, the dealership did their job and bought the vehicle for what it was sold for."
"at the time, it seemed like a cool feature and didn‚Äôt know they were going to discontinue service 3 years later."
and i understand that it‚Äôs a service.
"that's unfortunate,  i've received the best service from the dealership on my 2014 elantra than any other dealership i've ever dealt with."
"if you‚Äôre hyundai usa, part of your job is making sure your dealers give a good impression of you."
"if there‚Äôs a hyundai authorized dealer emblem on the dealership, it‚Äôs part of the experience one associates with the car."
and it‚Äôs pretty-well acknowledged both here and the hyundai forums i‚Äôve been on that the us dealership network needs some real lessons in customer care.
"that said, i was always happy with my little underpowered suv and the dealership near my office was always nice to me."
i was very pleased with the service i received.
"i obviously am not defending anyone (including hyundai) who has a subscription service, but i'm just saying that this doesn't need a class action lawsuit ü§£."
genesis 2018+ is a separate everything as far as service goes that's why.
"i did it for a merc, porsche, audi and rolls dealership and also serviced a kia/genesis  dealership, and the difference is night and say"
i drive a veloster n that has the recall and absolutely love it and haven‚Äôt had any issues with it or the dealership i deal with (knock on wood).
this is why i shop around to different dealers.
find one that actually has the services i need like loaners
"in these parts , its because of the dealer and after service issues, if that can be sorted out i think kia 7 hyundai will come tops"
when they comes in for service throw em in a sonata and hope they like it enough to get one for his spouse/kids etc.
the dealership loves the easy ones.
allow me to show you the number of hyundai dealers in my not-so-rural area.
"decided to drive a bit further to another dealership and they did everything i wanted, including rotations and right oil, for free, no hassle."
"a bit of trial and error, but i notice the nicer dealerships (the fancier waiting areas, free food, etc) tend to be better than say the small town ones."
"hopefully, this helps at the dealership when i bring it in for the oil consumption test on tuesday."
my hyundai dealership did this to me too.
i‚Äôve never personally owned a hyundai but my parents had one and it was constantly at the dealer.
"top tier dealership, great people."
"hyundai can make all the coolest cars in the world, but their dealers are who interacts with the customers"
if you or anyine can recommend a dealer in the nyc area i'd give it a shot.
yeah its independently owned but it has the brand's name and is connected to a dealership that exclusively sells the brand.
"even when having complimentary maintenance, you need to explicitly tell the service department which of those services you want ‚Äúredeemed‚Äù while you‚Äôre there."
"this is my first hybrid, told my wife we are probably taking a big gamble as it's well into it's service life and hybrids are insanely complex in the electronics."
no dealer is bothered by having one or two on the lot.
"if you‚Äôre outside of any powertrain coverage, from my experiences, it‚Äôs pretty much on you unless your dealer goes to bat for you and attempts to get it covered under some form of goodwill."
it is good to get it to the dealer for the consumption testing for documentation sake.
that works if you have multiple hyundai dealerships within service range.
i've driven a hyundai since 2007 and have no issues with my dealership.
the tech guy at my dealer had never heard of it.
probably a lot of salesmen and dealership owners in here.
all at the dealer level.
"also every dealership is different, some do a goodwill gesture and most don‚Äôt."
they are not the cheapest but they have consistently been ranked at or near the top for customer service.
dealer availability.
"i have here at least 3 different companies, within the range on 10km, who are official dealership for hmc (either for hyundai or kia)."
a great thing about my dealer is they are waiting for a loaner car return so they can service my car and give me the loaner.
"hyundai replaced my engine without a hassle, my car re-sale value is fairly stable, my auto insurance renewed in october with no increase, and the 5 hyundai dealers near me are all still in business."
getting a loaner during a service (longer than an oil change) has never been an issue.
"during peak covid, they would drop a loaner at our home, take our car, service it and bring it back."
any of us can start a dealership and handle it how we want.
but i have a 22 kona and have had mostly good luck with the brand over our last seven cars and the dealership gave us a good deal.
99 a month if you get the gps service.
it'd be awesome if dealerships had cars.
my two honda dealers *always* had loaners.
"in your case you bought a car, it doesn‚Äôt entitle you for free service."
i can say my dealership has some.
"admittedly, the multitude of horror stories about customer service still isn't enough to scare me away as a potential customer cause i am just *that* interested in what the koreans are offering nowadays, but i'm just crossing my fingers that it doesn't happen to me."
"if the dealer experience is good (sales, maintenance, etc."
that is something corporate works out with the dealer since corporate is paying for the warranty repair.
but the dealers are independent.
every dealer acts on their own.
there‚Äôs definitely no competition for service.
two honda dealers.
it‚Äôs in the same ownership group as one of the honda dealers and the difference in service quality is significant.
the dealership i work for makes sure that tire rotations are completed with each complimentary visit.
