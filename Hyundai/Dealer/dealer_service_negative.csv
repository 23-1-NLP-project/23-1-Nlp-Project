its their dealership shitty experience.

and then me logging into genesisdealer where everything 2018+ is covered and listed since it's a seperate thing since 2018"
now the dealers are at war with the manufacturer over warranty claims.
lte cell service isn't cheap lol
"as far as the dealer service goes, they are awful and i only go to the dealer when i simply have to."
"kbb prices the car at a number that includes the markup ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i made a lot of calls, some dealers were asking 10k over."
i did all the tests and services they recommended to try to diagnose and fix the issues.
"op wouldn't be dealing with the insurance if his car wasn't that vulnerable and got stolen, and hyundai's dealership response didn't help either when they're affiliated with the company that caused all of this."
"plus his treatment wasn't due to hyundai, it's due to the dealers"
hyundai dealerships are famously bad.
"i should add that this dealer and another dealer i talked to in the area are both saying that they havent gotten a single approval from hyundai corporate on anything relating to oil consumption issues and this induction cleaning every 30k is what everyone is supposed to be doing to fix the problem, but that just sounds like a soggy bandaid on a defective organ, and doesnt stop the carbon build up from ruining your catalytic converters either."
"also, i bought it used through carmax, so no dealing with an actual hyundai dealership."
"i've had 5 hyundais and i really like the brand, but i absolutely hate having to go through a dealer or their service department."
"my problem with hyundai has never been the cars, it‚Äôs the dealers/customer service."
"i‚Äôd buy again, but i‚Äôd have to find a dealer that wasn‚Äôt sketchy af."
i'll say the warranty they brag about is a lot harder to get service for.
my local dealer was recently sold to a new owner and everything there has taken a dive since üò©
"with the corolla, we had oil leaks, exhaust system replacements, a bunch of other stuff i‚Äôve forgotten about, and traded it in (presumably for sale to a scrap dealer) when the thing mercifully gave up and died after 6 years of ownership."
"also, their customer service refused to honor the warranty (oil consumption issues on sonata 2017)."
the dealer has hyundai logo doesn‚Äôt it?
i think it depends on your local dealerships a lot though.
the hyundai dealership network is the weak link for hyundai.
one of the old car dogs i used to work with said the dealer he worked for would give away free fire extinguishers with every pinto.
it‚Äôs a known issue for elantra gts they just released an updated update for elantra gts go back to the dealer and have them do it should not be charged to redo the update
we have one hyundai dealer.
you have a known history of spinning the narrative in favour of hyundai dealers.
genesis/hyundai dealership i bought that one from gave me $4k or it.
the service center tried bribing me to change a negative review after their employee sped out of the service lot with a 300 mile old car with a bubble on a tire to get it changed offsite coupled with various other negatives that day.
after i didnt take their bribe they changed my name in their system to do not service.
similarly i cant use any dealership for any service because the wait time for an appointment is 2 to 3 months.
the woman at the dealership was arrogant and dismissive.
"the dealership wanted to charge $5k for the parts and labor, a significant chunk of what the car's worth."
"sounds like a dealership issue, mine apologized for not being able to get the parts in a timely manner."
my dealer did the oil and rotate every time.
"lastly, the guys you talk to in the service shop."
the dealer represents the brand therefore they are interchangeable.
"i also had a lemon sonata and got rid of it after a year, all hyundai dealerships in my area avoided my car cause none of them could fix the problems, the last one i went to was the one i bought from and i literally put me on the waiting list for months and when the time is due, they pushed it back again twice, to avoid failing to fix my car for my eligibility for lemon law."
"this is why i never buy hyundai again, just to avoid the god damn dealers."
"no, i had a 23 sonata hybrid and all the problems i had with that car was the reason why i didn‚Äôt go back and get another sonata hybrid after going through lemon law, mind you i‚Äôve had the car from late november to mid march and it‚Äôs been in the dealership for majority of that time i‚Äôve only had it in my possession for about a month."
there's a delay when you start through bluelink and when it starts due to it being over cell service.
"again, you're communicating with dealers, not hyundai."
"it's the dealers decision on how many loaners they have available, if any."
"she was able to show the service manager it happening, but has anyone else behind the wheel duplicated it?"
"the point remains that if hyundai dealerships get a reputation for being poor, the results will be the same."
"i‚Äôve had two issues with two dealerships in separate states, and my girlfriend in a third, with mixups or poor treatment."
"you can tell them that that‚Äôs the dealer‚Äôs fault until you‚Äôre blue in the face, but they‚Äôll still get a bad taste in their mouths, and if it happens enough, it can and will affect impressions of the vehicles as a whole."
"some of that was a hyundai issue, and some of it was likely a dealer issue."
weird i never received notice of the service ending.
finally traded it in for a mazda cx5 when dealership wanted 4k to fix the latest engine issue.
i‚Äôm guessing you are talking about dealerships not upholding the warranty?
"which involves doing all the oil consumption texts, scoping the engines, and anything else the dealers can do to make a few bucks and then turning people done if they can find any reason to do so but helping the cases they'd have the biggest problems denying and them saying "" look at us, aren't we wonderful""."
oem software is not available to the public and requires active dealership logins to use
"hyundia has some great ideas and i can see how their cars could definitely take a good chunk of market share from other manufacturers,  but at the end of the day if they can't produce a solid ten years of good reputation with their vehicles and service, they're going ro have a hard time getting ahead."
these engines go out fast and usually after service.
dealerships in the us are often separate from the brand.
i still need to hassle my dealer (again) for the 2nd key i‚Äôve been waiting nearly a year for too‚Ä¶
i understand your issues but hyundai as a brand has literally nothing to do with scumbag dealership groups.
i don‚Äôt disagree with you at all but i don‚Äôt think i have ever been able to get a loaner from any dealer i have bought a car from‚Ä¶ heck even body shops these days have almost no loaners.
chances are they will have to do like my dealer and reflash the update with the assistance of hyundai support.
shit experience when dealing with warranty service.
in my opinion nobody should ever give the koeppel service department any business since in my experience they can not be trusted.
i am fairly new to reddit so i haven't figured out how to post the video and the pictures of the service records.
the only positive was the very small local dealership that hyundai required me to have it towed to and they performed the engine exchange was helpful.
all euro dealers do that for free.
"you should be checking your oil every 2-3 fuel fill-ups, just like the ""good old days"" when the service station would check your oil at every fill-up."
"not even 24 hours after the dealer replaced the engine, same thing happened."
dealer couldn‚Äôt figure it out so they sent me home with the typical ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs normal behavior‚Äù.
"that‚Äôs actually not true, manufacturers allocate a certain amount of loaners to each dealership based on various factors."
i‚Äôm a technician at a dealership.
your dealer is just lazy.
many people have had issues but it is typically a widget that needs replacing during a routine scheduled service.
"hyundai was a third rate manufacturer not too long ago, and kia was selling cheap crappy cars through shady dealerships in the near past."
probably they meant they're out of loaner cars at all dealerships because of the backlog of crazy repairs lately on these cars
i bought one 1-2 months before the pandemic and every dealer was msrp or 500-1k above.
no dealer wanted to even negotiate.
the brand needs to police the dealers and they need to write better franchise agreements in terms.
maybe call a dealer or the company and see for sure.
"i left a review about it and their gm responded with a long message on how much of a crook i was for ‚Äúwasting their time‚Äù

psycho dealership"
it's always been done through the dealership.
i would certainly file a complaint against the dealership too.
what i would really be mad about is the heated seats in bmw being a subscription service.
i would tend to agree but it happened to the hyundai dealer too
neither the little sticker the dealer put on the window about the software update or the club on the steering wheel deterred the attempt.
they asked where we wanted it towed and we had it towed to the dealership.
i know some guys at the dealership and we looked and the car was fucked.
i'm on the hyundai service plan aswell.
"to be fair, i've only ever dealt with the one dealership so my experience is extremely limited."
they did eventually replace it and gave me a couple free services because of their mistake.
"you're not the player, the dealership is."
and that is between two different dealership.
my dealer's response is similar to yours.
i didn't see any updates from those who actually said they had their car at the dealership trying to fix the issue.
"again that's a dealer issue, warranty doesn't cover a rental."
get on the phone and start calling dealers.
and dealer s get stuck with cars they can not sell because they can not be insured.
"when i spoke to the hyundai dealership, they basically told me it‚Äôs probably best if i just get rid of the car, unless i wanted to pay $10-12k for a new engine and wait about 3 months for the engine to come in."
the rest could be true of any other dealership/manufacturers.
sometimes those warranties will allow the car to be at the vehicle brand‚Äôs dealer or the ford dealer may farm the work out to the hyundai dealer.
either way i‚Äôd at least look into that because i have done several engines for various warranty companies sold by other manufacturer‚Äôs dealerships.
my biggest issue has been my dealerships service department.
"ive decided my service advisor doesn‚Äôt actually exist as every call i‚Äôve ever placed, email i‚Äôve ever sent, and visit i‚Äôve ever made to communicate with vince has been met with zero response."
"i bought a 2013 from this dealership and i got 45900 out of the 1st engine then got 95,000 out of the second engine!"
honestly i think the issue is the dealers.
"i love my veloster n, but the hyundai dealership experience is abysmal."
"i wouldn‚Äôt mind a genesis g80 as an upgrade, but with the dealer network tied to hyundai, i‚Äôll probably look elsewhere."
it took original sales paperwork and a battle with the warranty department to get my dealership to recognize that i was the original owner to qualify for the oil consumption testing.
"so unless you purchased 2nd hand from a dealer that extended the original warranty to you as a second owner and you are returning to that same dealer, be prepared to potentially be denied your warranty claim."
https://autoservice.
i heard from the dealer after leaving a voicemail.
"i'm pretty sure there is a contract between corporate and the dealer which specifies what the dealer needs to do (procedures, requirements, sales events, etc."
the dealer is an independent business but they cannot just act on their own.
"the hyundai service centers around here could never figure out how to keep my tpms light off, there's no way i would trust them to be able to fix something on an ioniq 5."
"2 different dealership service centers, 8 days total without my car so far, nobody can figure out why to fix it and nobody will give me a rental/loaner
i will never buy another hyundai again."
"in fact, all you fools paying way over msrp are gonna be crying into your wallets when the bubble pops and you lose the normal 50-60% on resale or trade-in value, plus all the free money you gave to the dealer to butt fuck you."
simple things such as that 'void' warranty (which they look for any excuses to do so) so talk with whatever dealership you planning to buy with before making that decision.
i once made an appointment with a hyundai dealership and when i arrived i didn‚Äôt have an appointment lol üòÇ had to wait three hours for a tire change
"i bought a new hyundai in 2016, while i‚Äôve never had a major break down, the times i‚Äôve had to take my car into the dealer for work, whether it be maintenance or repairs, i‚Äôve never had a good experience."
i‚Äôve actually have had bad experiences at multiple dealers.
went to at least 4 different dealerships - same shady practices.
can't just be a dealer issue.
the service manage failed to turn in the warranty claim within the first 30 days so we had to go through the prior authorization part twice and i was pissed.
overall it was the worst experience i‚Äôve ever had with dealerships.
but they are making my dealership pay for my car to be detailed and the battery holder that was missing when i got my car back to be replaced.
they are the worst customer service service department and quality vehicles.
than their dealers are the other massive issue.
both kia and hyundai dealers are such a mixed bag for what each brand is trying to do.
"i have seen it myself where my previous dealership would do some scummy ass stuff in their service department to trick you into $1000 service just 30k miles in to your new car, while my new dealer has never once tried to sell me anything extra and even tried to save me money offering me alternatives if i wanted."
"its an uphill battle for the what hyundai is trying to be and they are slowly getting there but until they have a solid reliability record for a good stretch of time and fix their stupid ass dealerships, its going to keep being the same."
but there‚Äôs a lot (and i mean a lot) of very mediocre hyundai dealers.
the dealers should either provide a loaner car or pay for a rental car up front while the poor car owners have to wait literally months for repairs.
"sure that may be only 1 issue, but when you are down a car for 3+ months with no loaner and you are forced to interact with service managers that blink at you like they are goldfish."
many hyundai dealerships are known to be scums.
the frustrating part is how the dealership and corporate handle it though.
do not trust dealerships.
"got it towed to the dealership, and they quoted it to be both the battery and starter and quoted over $1000 ($650 of which was the battery!"
do not go to dealerships if its not under warranty.
i guess it's the difference in dealers.
dealer pockets it all.
i have had zero issues with my 2020 santa fe and with my dealer.
i overheard our local dealer say they were going for 3k over.
this isn't a dealer level issue.
"it's not a brand wide issue, it's a specific dealer issue, it's maybe a dozen or two low volume dealers in more rural areas out of nearly 1000 i j the country, 

when there's only 1 hyundai dealer within an hour, the custom service is probably going to be questionable at best."
progressive is a company that will do their best to make sure the process is as painful as possible so you do not use their service.
"msrp was $$22k, dealer was selling for $28k, with 9% apr."
"when they are the only hyundai dealer in the area, what is the difference?"
"hyundai usa is shit for help, the dealers are shit for help."
that sounds like a dealer issue than a brand issue
i saw superman burn it with his eyes cause he had to pay market adjustment at dealership
"unless it has a recall or warranty, it's not worth taking older vehicles to the dealer."
you probably thought i was serious about hyundai having really nice dealerships too
just because you got hooked on their service doesn‚Äôt make you entitled for free service after the fact.
i have a case manager at hyundai corporate who so far has no information and basically just repeats back to me what the dealer tells me which is just peak customer service
"you have a valid claim, don't like your dealership bs out, get hyundai involved."
"personally, i would not set foot in that dealership again."
reports already dealers charging over $200 for the immobilizer.
"while i agree with the general content of the letter, i always advise people to never say you won‚Äôt ever go there, buy their product, use their service ever again."
"not only did the dealership want to charge more for the repair (as expected), they would provide no timeline for the repair, except to say 3+ months was ‚Äúpossible,‚Äù although they really had no idea when parts would be available."
"the dealer also charged a $160 fee to assess the vehicle before ever lifting a finger to repair, then provided no itemized list of necessary work/parts on the estimate, following the assessment‚Äîhonestly, there‚Äôs no evidence it was ever rolled into the shop."
"the last straw for me was when the dealer said we would have two switchblade keys after the repair‚Äîone for the door, and the other for the ignition (since the new cylinder would come with a new key)."
"the independent mechanic fixed our car in 2 weeks, using non-oem steering column trim, found & fixed tons of issues not found in the dealer‚Äôs ‚Äúassessment,‚Äù and we have the same old key working as it should (the original cylinder was snapped off, but left in the center console."
) all this for hundreds of $$ less than the dealer.
it was the total lack of good service practices by hyundai.
‚Äú sounds like a dealer issue not a brand issue.
"if your dealer is going to bat for you, that‚Äôs a good thing, some will, some flat out don‚Äôt seem to care."
"see if they can give you someone to talk to at hyundai, or call customer service yourself."
"if all of this fails, you could try to go back to the selling (kia) dealer and seek assistance there."
"you don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs a dealer problem‚Äù; that‚Äôs how your customers say ‚Äúi‚Äôll go to a brand of car where i don‚Äôt experience dealer issues‚Äù."
i can‚Äôt just drive to hyundai usa headquarters and expect them to do warranty service; we all know that‚Äôs not how it works.
"after an oil consumption test, the local dealer decided to run another oil consumption test and determine if the connecting rod bearings were the issue."
"2022 santa fe hybrid, after the software update my passenger airbag light comes on randomly (it's in for service now)."
mercedes is also making a subscription service.
a lot of auto manufacturers have subscription services.
"i ask months ago if i could also make an appointment for the dct issues, i was told it needs to be replaced, however i was also told that hyundai needs to order the transmission first and once it arrives i can make an appointment üòë then my bf tells me (hyundai dealer) that hma doesn‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs wrong so warranty work will not fix the issue at this time."
it sounds like a dealer warranty which isn't worth a damn thing.
that really sounds like a dealer problem.
i mention that it was second hand when i bought it because a few people are mentioning hyundai's customer service which i have never experienced.
the dealer would not acknowledge the issue until i drove it with the tech after they tried to recreate it for 2 weeks.
"i have a lifetime powertrain warranty from the dealership i bought the car from, but it's a ford dealership, so i'm hesitant to have them work on it."
hyundai customer service is now out of the country.
"still though, after working for dealers for 36 years, i can honestly say that the threat of never returning never works the way you‚Äôd like it to."
don't thin hyundai isn't aware of the dealership issues.
"in my area, i think only 2 hyundai dealerships are allowed to carry genesis out of 6 or more."
i get the feeling they are being picky about which of their dealerships can even touch genesis.
"in fairness, i think they're aware of the problem, but they risk losing a lot of sales if they just put the hammer down on shitty dealerships - which might be a lot of them - or even cut them out."
as others have commented on this post other dealerships have loaner cars for hyundai.
"the second i heard this manager say no hyundai gives loaners i knew it was a lie as they're all independently owned and i guarantee some dealerships want to retain business and offer loaners, which they do."
why blame the vendor for your own negligence in knowing this service ain‚Äôt free?
"they seem to have issues mostly in us, not only related to the cars but also dealerships."
dealerships being horrid is a brand issue.
hyundai and kia and genesis dealerships are awful like worst in the industry.
establish luxury brands have such a better dealership experience.
and now the manufacturer and the dealers are at war (beside the class action lawsuits) with each other.
or email a service advisor and see if they have something else available?
the dealer i use is always a month out.
i emailed my service advisor and she got me in 3 weeks earlier.
i don‚Äôt even have bluelink and my dealer was pretty clear about the 3 years free period and the cost after if i wanted to keep it.
i‚Äôm on my 3rd hyundai and they‚Äôve all been virtually trouble free and i have an awesome local dealer but i have noticed they‚Äôve gone downhill a little since covid.
i used to drop my car off for service and they‚Äôd give me a ride to my office now they don‚Äôt have a driver anymore so i need to find a ride myself.
tying said preferences (however limited) to a cloud service was apparently high on the list of priorities.
"either breaking down, blowing up and dealers not owning up to the warranty."
"the dealership was an absolute nightmare to deal with, and i was out of a car for a good majority of it."
their dealers need some type of reform.
you wouldn‚Äôt get this bullshit from a bmw dealer
there is no such thing as good customer service anymore with hyundai.
at our dealership its the same.
also i use the dealership site and all cars including genesis cars are all in the same site so stop spouting shite hyundaidealer.
com its the same for every dealership.
i am a auto tech at a dealership what nonsense are you spouting?
or is it the hyundai dealer?
showed the service dept where i marked and they took the car back in and they watched as the tech rotated the tires.
you should be able to get that fixed at the dealer for free.
seems like a lot of the hyundai dealers leave you walking if there‚Äôs any problems.
your first mistake was trusting the dealership.
"my ioniq is good, but the after-sales service is painful"
"i understand the market right now, but dealers are hyping up exclusivity and difficulty ordering in‚Ä¶ hyundai tried to charge me 3/4k over msrp and once they realized i was going to buy elsewhere the number was magically msrp."
a big thing slowing down hyundai brand perception is the dealer experience .
"dealer culture is slow to change and it's still stuck in the ""we'll finance anyone, take this crap car"" days of old hyundai."
"so, to the extent that hyundai corporate can fix the dealer issues, hopefully."
engine seized randomly at mid to low mileage = dealer issue?
"made the the dealership take engine photos and track down every oil change i got, but now i‚Äôm driving a 2023 hybrid elantra loaner while they wait 5 months to get a engine replacement‚Ä¶
so, maybe yea, but sell the thing before you hit that 100k mark."
"they were using the hyundai dealership network, so i asked what programs they would be implementing to match the dealer services offered by other luxury brands and they looked at me like i had two heads."
the smart brands offer cash to dealerships to incentivize them to offer loaners.
i dont need it i just found an article on jalopnik or something discussing the markups on the engine immobilizer bought through dealership even above the markup for same product elsewhere and the price hyundai announced.
"the key is finding a dealership that is run well, by people who actively value the chance at return customers (again, all brands)

bottom line is i get more value out of hyundai than i do ford or toyota or vw, and more value out of genesis than i would out of mercedes and bmw"
only the phevs have 3k markup at the local dealer.
my point was when a service advisor says you need so and so.
their service departments are pur shit.
"mine at the dealership as well, engine misfire under 20k miles."
"i'm a little late here, but getting the most out of the complimentary maintenance is dealership based it feels like."
"my local dealership refuses to put 0w-20 in my car, no matter how much i ask."
"if you're not happy with the dealership you're going to, i highly recommend taking your money elsewhere to another one."
hyundai dealership networks are the worst.
"it's a luxury brand, and they payed more money for the premium service."
"i‚Äôm not just complaining about having to pay, it‚Äôs the discontinued service after only 4 years."
poor dealership experience.
"thankfully my dealership experience was pretty smooth, everything was covered under warranty including rental car and turn around time was about 2 weeks."
"when i owned a nissan sentra, the nissan dealership would indeed go over each item of the multi-point inspection, showing me which items were red, yellow, or green."
"not only did the document list each item, but the service advisor explained each item, one-by-one, without my even asking."
"net/products/nissan-multi-point-inspection-forms) 

but when i've taken my hyundai elantra to two different hyundai dealerships, both of them just give me a receipt saying that a multi-point inspection was done."
i wonder if the honda dealer never received the 2nd key from the previous owner.
you created inflation and made dealers even worse than they already are.
i don‚Äôt mind the car so much (21 elantra) as so much i hate the dealer.
"i can‚Äôt speak to the ownership experience, but i had such a dreadful time at the dealer when i was looking at a genesis g70 that i just gave up."
i had to go to a hyundai dealership to see the car and they didn‚Äôt have the same spec at all compared to the one i inquired about from their website.
so i have a 2 minute test drive since there isn‚Äôt any gas and come back to the dealership.
they would hit dealerships and valet places
"after a series of exchanges between the progressive agent and a potential dealership just to give me a date- note, they won‚Äôt talk to each other."
"i am literally forwarding their emails to each other and following up for replies- the agent gets a quote, the dealership revises the quote, and the progressive agent just sends me the money for the repair, closes the claim and ghosts me."
i am currently on day 5 of trying to get ahold of the dealership‚Äôs service advisor that is also not responding to my emails or answering my calls.
"imo, poor customer service at the dealership is the biggest issue with hyundai."
"unfortunately, hma doesn't control dealership network well."
independent dealership is a foreign concept to korean executives.
dealers have been charging markups since this vehicle came out.
my opinion might change if say my engine failed and my dealer dealt with it very well.
"dealership isn't very communicative, took them multiple days to even get to diagnosing the issue, and a rental car has only been offered for a maximum of 5 days."
when i bought our 2021 palisade calligraphy i drove nearly 200mi to save the $10k my local dealer was trying to mark up on the same car.
i too have had nightmare dealership experience every time.
like the car but not worth the dealers bs
the service manager was in the vehicle when it happened once.
both times we had to insist there were problems with the vehicle and they just blindly recommend service to get your $$ without trying to solve the problem you're having.
"if dealerships don't have cars to sell, they're very unlikely to have cars to loan out."
someone i know got a brand new santa fe and the ac wasn‚Äôt working from the day they got it and the dealer couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúduplicate‚Äù it.
the problem is the dealers are still setup/act like it's a budget brand.
i've read stories of dealers refusing oil changes below 8k intervals or minimum times between changes.
i dont have a dealer i use.
the dealership i bought from changed my name to do not service in their system.
"also, i work at the dealer level in parts and service."
"but, i think their dealerships, at least in the us, are legitimately holding back their brand image."
i think quite a few dealerships haven't progressed in the same way the cars have.
"i admit, while i love the cars genesis have, part of me is hesitant to seriously consider genesis because of the idea that if i'm going to drop that kind of money on a car, why would i accept a dealership experience that pales in comparison to competitors like lexus, nevermind european brands like bmw and audi."
"came with a clean carfax only touched by dealers, but the previous work by someone was absolutely hideous."
yes there are scum dealers charging $10k-$20k markups which are clearly out of line.
i work at a dealer.
it‚Äôs getting serviced june 26.
"it isn‚Äôt the one that sold me the car because the elantra gt n-line only sold here 2019-2020, and a lot of dealers never got them."
"but  any non-warranty work other than oil changes (less expensive, any dealer can do them, and it creates a paper trail in case oil consumption becomes an issue) will be done by my own mechanic, and this is one of many reason."
it's all on the dealership.
"i'm gonna have to come at my dealer like this, really sucks ""trying to tell someone their job""."
i had an oil consumption test at the dealership per their recommendation.
was it from your dealership or hyundai in general?
then i paid monthly and i got emails and letters saying they were discontinuing the service and my car was affected.
customer service is definitely shit
"never again hyundai, and never again any autofair dealer."
"when i was offered to go work for a hyundai dealer in 2016 i  thought yeah i'll go work for them, those things are junk so there should be plenty of opportunity and fixing broke cars is how we make a living in parts/service."
a 12-year-old car has no business in a dealership except safety recalls.
the dealership couldn‚Äôt figure it out so they sent me home stating that‚Äôs normal for smoke to come out.
dealers have nothing to do with the quality or reliability of a vehicle.
"everytime they go into the dealer for diagnostics, they can't replicate the problems."
all you have to do is go to the dealer for a update thats stops this
i was thinking about getting a genesis and was told i would need to drive an hour or hour and half to the closest genesis service shop each time the vehicle needed service because my hyundai was not certified for genesis 18+.
do you get that money back in some form or does the dealer pocket it all?
the service department should have told you why hyundai declined.
"we have an absolutely shitty hyundai dealership near my work, but there are better ones also around."
try a different dealership or find a trustworthy independent.
"that dealership may not be lying necessarily but just not very savvy, not very thorough, and/or maybe they just don‚Äôt give a shit."
"oh, a dealer tried to screw me into an $800 repair, charged me for the estimate then doubled down that they had that right and threatened to call the cops on me, when i  asked for my money back."
they are unreliable at the dealership and can‚Äôt communicate.
"and if i say in the built-in satnav that route to nearest hyundai authorized workshop, then it's actually a kia's dealer."
because most people in this sub don‚Äôt understand how cars are manufactured and instead rely on how pretty it looks on the dealers lot and all the jd power awards for quality hyundai/kia has paid millions of dollars to win.
"but the several hyundai dealerships i‚Äôve been to give me little to no faith that someone will be around if i have a problem, or that they‚Äôll care at all."
i never got that kind of feeling with either of the two honda dealers in my city.
my last oil change was done at the local hyundai dealer.
"too many recalls, theta engine, kia boys, crappy dealership experience."
"i just bought a new santa cruz, so will knock on wood when i say i've never experienced a single issue that brought me back to a dealer on any hyundai/genesis."
dealer performed theft prevention update (without my knowledge).
dropped by the dealer the next day and they did something that turned the warning light off.
went back again for service and they were unable to get the warning system to behave correctly.
get dealership to do an oil consumption test.
"just to warm up the car while i am on trip 

my dealer told me that"
dealership experience is worse than buy here pay here used car lots.
now the dealers are at war with the manufacturer over warranty claims.
and i didn't hear the dealer say it (though maybe they did?
either way i still think $200 is way too much for the service.
i got 10k firm at some dealers.
"christ, i work at a western star dealer and we've had to send back a ton of detroit diesel engines (which cost more then a car) for rebuilt and repair."
dealership called corporate and we are waiting on a new update to fix these issues.
"dealer happened to volunteer the information that this year alone, they replaced about 250 engines."
"in exchange for the cheap price and 10-year/100k mile warranty, you get a shitty dealership experience and a car that is easily stolen."
"ok, so never ever go to a dealership to repair your used car, especially if it's a hyundai/kia dealer."
"in fact, my hyundai dealership told me that they're \*required\* to rotate the tires with every complimentary oil change, and that hyundai will deny a complimentary oil change if it isn't accompanied by a tire rotation."
"if the tire manufacturer inspects the tires and says they weren't rotated, then you probably have a claim against the dealership for failing to provide the services that you ""paid"" for (according to the receipts)."
they‚Äôre turning the service off?
"that‚Äôs the thing, they probably have it written in a terms of service that hyundai can terminate the service at any time."
"was a certified preowned vehicle from a honda dealer, and when i contacted them through the service to say hey could i possibly get it a little longer as i maybe used it twice, they sent an automatic email back saying they couldn‚Äôt deal with my enquiry."
our geico rep that comes into our dealership confirmed this.
salesmen have told me they have to request loaners and a lot of dealers will avoid it because a loaner that gets sent to them replaces a car they can sell.
i love my hyundai but hate the dealerships.
i think the service fee for viper smartstart is like $10.
my hyundai dealer was supposed to receive 1 venue .
"com/news/crime/car-thieves-mostly-steal-kias-and-hyundais-police-say/spfphvbioja6heosx57fry6omm/

in my recent experience (a $160 service visit to look at the car and multiple calls to other dealers), atlanta dealerships are totally overwhelmed and do not appear to know what they are doing."
the dealership i went to had one repair waiting on parts for 3 months.
my dealer has flat-out said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have loaners‚Äù when telling me my service might run into the next day.
the nice thing for me is that my unpopular opinion should save me some money when dealers are trying to move the current car in preparation for the new one.
this one will be traded in in three weeks as this is a dealer buyback.
so if i buy a cable modem am i entitled to free internet service?
"i mean i paid for the modem, so  why do i have to pay comcast every month for their service?"
not sure if cars sold at a non-hyundai/kia dealer are eligible.
when i was buying my elantra  dealers all around were charging 3-6k mark up.
ended up finding a couple dealerships without the mark up and now i got my elantra at msrp.
it‚Äôs just sounded like that is why you were at the service station.
i was so fed up with condescending dealer i did research and found hyundai was a better choice across the board.
"as someone who's pre-ordered three hmc cars and is coming from a bmw, it's not the dependability/reliability issues of the *cars* that scare me - it's the dogshit dealer service that's rampant in north america."
"i subscribe to all three hmc subs as well as bmw/audi/mercedes subs (plus their respective car service/repair subs) and anecdotally speaking, customers at hmc brands are getting far worse service."
"i love the bold and handsome designs and amazing features-packed offerings of the koreans, but time and time again they are (and always have been) let down by atrocious customer service."
"if i walk into a kia dealership, the salesman who insists on running a credit check before i can test drive a stinger can go fuck himself."
"the customer interacts with the dealer, not the brand and not corporate."
the customer does not care what goes on between the dealer and corporate and who pays for what.
can i open up my own dealership without hyundai's permission?
"if i could, then that would be an independent dealer."
"they wouldn‚Äôt ship to a dealership near me, cover transportation or cover a rental while they received the engine."
"they brag about their warranties and guarantees, but have the worst customer service and ‚Äúcase managers‚Äù i have ever encountered."
"his point was that if they were all near each other, competition drives better pricing and higher quality service."
every one of those dealers is 40 minutes or more apart (some 60-90).
i drove 100 miles to get my elantra gt n-line to a dealership not on that map.
"but who has the easy ability to do that with service, especially if a cel is on?"
i probably have half a dozen chevy dealers in my city.
two toyota dealers.
we have one hyundai dealer.
"from my understanding, the service department at the hyundai dealership it‚Äôs currently at is confirming that is is the engine bearings which exactly is what is covered under warranty."
"they‚Äôre garaged, well serviced, mostly highway miles, so should be operating under pristine conditions for owners, but the multitude of quality problems i‚Äôve run into with them are a complete turnoff."
but how about a ton of community service free labor.
"and as far as ""redeeming"" goes, comp maint is considered warranty work, so when filing the online approval for the service, you only select the mileage interval."
there is no option to select services.
that is due to the way the warranty claim for this service works.
"i‚Äôd still say brand perception, dealership and servicing (some of the worst and shadiest in the country), and the shoddy quality of older cars (engine issues, ability to steal cars that aren‚Äôt keyless, cheaper parts compared to newer releases) are not helping them."
